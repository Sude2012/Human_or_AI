"We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.",human
"Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D ""trace-space"" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.",human
"Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.",human
"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.",human
"Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.",human
"MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning. Our project page will be available at https://weihao-bo.github.io/ViLoMeo-page.",human
"Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.",human
"Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.",human
"The rise of AI in telecommunications, from optimizing Radio Access Networks to managing user experience, has sharply increased data volumes and training demands. Telecom data is often noisy, high-dimensional, costly to store, process, and label. Despite Ai's critical role, standard workflows still assume all training samples contribute equally. On the other hand, next generation systems require AI models that are accurate, efficient, and sustainable.The paper questions the assumptions of equal importance by focusing on applying and analyzing the roles of individual samples in telecom training and assessing whether the proposed model optimizes computation and energy use. we perform sample-level gradient analysis across epochs to identify patterns of influence and redundancy in model learning. Based on this, we propose a sample importance framework thats electively prioritizes impactful data and reduces computation without compromising accuracy. Experiments on three real-world telecom datasets show that our method [reserves performance while reducing data needs and computational overhead while advancing the goals of sustainable AI in telecommunications.",human
"Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.",human
"In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.",human
"We introduce EvilGenie, a benchmark for reward hacking in programming settings. We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents. Our codebase can be found at https://github.com/JonathanGabor/EvilGenie.",human
"The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.",human
"Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.",human
"AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's ""the unavoidable a priori""). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.",human
"Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures. All code is available at: https://github.com/AnanthaPadmanaban-KrishnaKumar/Cliff-Plateau-Climb.",human
"We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.",human
"Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.",human
"Recent work by Freedman and Mulligan demonstrated that shallow multilayer perceptrons spontaneously develop Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structure during training on synthetic three-dimensional tasks. However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.   We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized machine learning on text-attributed graphs, but the application of LLMs to graph outlier detection, particularly in the context of fake news detection, remains significantly underexplored. One of the key challenges is the scarcity of large-scale, realistic, and well-annotated datasets that can serve as reliable benchmarks for outlier detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce TAGFN, a large-scale, real-world text-attributed graph dataset for outlier detection, specifically fake news detection. TAGFN enables rigorous evaluation of both traditional and LLM-based graph outlier detection methods. Furthermore, it facilitates the development of misinformation detection capabilities in LLMs through fine-tuning. We anticipate that TAGFN will be a valuable resource for the community, fostering progress in robust graph-based outlier detection and trustworthy AI. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kayzliu/TAGFN and our code is available at https://github.com/kayzliu/tagfn.",human
"Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.",human
"Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified ""skill neurons"" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.",human
"Handling missing data is a central challenge in data-driven analysis. Modern imputation methods not only aim for accurate reconstruction but also differ in how they represent and quantify uncertainty. Yet, the reliability and calibration of these uncertainty estimates remain poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of uncertainty in imputation, comparing representative methods from three major families: statistical (MICE, SoftImpute), distribution alignment (OT-Impute), and deep generative (GAIN, MIWAE, TabCSDI). Experiments span multiple datasets, missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and missingness rates. Uncertainty is estimated through three complementary routes: multi-run variability, conditional sampling, and predictive-distribution modeling, and evaluated using calibration curves and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Results show that accuracy and calibration are often misaligned: models with high reconstruction accuracy do not necessarily yield reliable uncertainty. We analyze method-specific trade-offs among accuracy, calibration, and runtime, identify stable configurations, and offer guidelines for selecting uncertainty-aware imputers in data cleaning and downstream machine learning pipelines.",human
"The rise of generative AI has enabled the production of high-fidelity synthetic tabular data across fields such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, raising growing concerns about data provenance and misuse. Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across many natural language tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain difficult to interpret. In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research. We make our code available at https://github.com/Vainateya/Feature_Geometry_Visualization.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.",human
"Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.",human
"End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models have demonstrated strong performance in open-loop evaluations but often suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop settings. To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.",human
"Latent reasoning represents a new development in Transformer language models that has shown potential in compressing reasoning lengths compared to chain-of-thought reasoning. By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts. We make our code and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/apning/adaptive-latent-reasoning.",human
"The availability of high-quality, AI-generated audio raises security challenges such as misinformation campaigns and voice-cloning fraud. A key defense against the misuse of AI-generated audio is by watermarking it, so that it can be easily distinguished from genuine audio. As those seeking to misuse AI-generated audio may thus seek to remove audio watermarks, studying effective watermark removal techniques is critical to being able to objectively evaluate the robustness of audio watermarks against removal. Previous watermark removal schemes either assume impractical knowledge of the watermarks they are designed to remove or are computationally expensive, potentially generating a false sense of confidence in current watermark schemes.   We introduce HarmonicAttack, an efficient audio watermark removal method that only requires the basic ability to generate the watermarks from the targeted scheme and nothing else. With this, we are able to train a general watermark removal model that is able to remove the watermarks generated by the targeted scheme from any watermarked audio sample. HarmonicAttack employs a dual-path convolutional autoencoder that operates in both temporal and frequency domains, along with GAN-style training, to separate the watermark from the original audio. When evaluated against state-of-the-art watermark schemes AudioSeal, WavMark, and Silentcipher, HarmonicAttack demonstrates greater watermark removal ability than previous watermark removal methods with near real-time performance. Moreover, while HarmonicAttack requires training, we find that it is able to transfer to out-of-distribution samples with minimal degradation in performance.",human
"Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.",human
"Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling autonomous agents to solve complex tasks. As these systems scale in complexity, cost becomes an important consideration for practical deployment. However, existing work rarely addresses how to structure multi-agent systems under explicit budget constraints. In this paper, we propose BAMAS, a novel approach for building multi-agent systems with budget awareness. BAMAS first selects an optimal set of LLMs by formulating and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that balances performance and cost. It then determines how these LLMs should collaborate by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method to select the interaction topology. Finally, the system is instantiated and executed based on the selected agents and their collaboration topology. We evaluate BAMAS on three representative tasks and compare it with state-of-the-art agent construction methods. Results show that BAMAS achieves comparable performance while reducing cost by up to 86%.",human
"In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term ""responsible computational foresight"", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.",human
"If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a ""Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia"" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.",human
"Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.",human
"This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.",human
"We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.",human
"Vision Language Action models have significantly advanced general purpose robotic manipulation by harnessing large scale pretrained vision and language representations. Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.",human
"Human activity recognition (HAR) from inertial sensors is essential for ubiquitous computing, mobile health, and ambient intelligence. Conventional deep models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers have advanced HAR but remain limited by vanishing or exloding gradients, high computational cost, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Structured state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba address these challenges with linear complexity and effective temporal modeling, yet they are restricted to first-order dynamics without stable longterm memory mechanisms. We introduce Momentum Mamba, a momentum-augmented SSM that incorporates second-order dynamics to improve stability of information flow across time steps, robustness, and long-sequence modeling. Two extensions further expand its capacity: Complex Momentum Mamba for frequency-selective memory scaling. Experiments on multiple HAR benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains over vanilla Mamba and Transformer baselines in accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed. With only moderate increases in training cost, momentum-augmented SSMs offer a favorable accuracy-efficiency balance, establishing them as a scalable paradigm for HAR and a promising principal framework for broader sequence modeling applications.",human
"Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.",human

We also present the challenges towards developing the dataset and present some way forward by benchmarking with landmark based raw and RQE embedding. We do some ablation on vocabulary restriction and canonicalization of the same within the dataset, which resulted in two more datasets, IsharaKhobor_small and IsharaKhobor_canonical_small.

"Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.",human
"A fundamental theoretical question in network analysis is to determine under which conditions community recovery is possible in polynomial time in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics.   When $K \geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \geq \sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes.   The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \geq \sqrt{n}$ communities. They also indicate that, in moderately sparse regimes, the optimal algorithms appear to be fundamentally different from spectral methods.",human
"The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.",human
"Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.",human
"Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.",human
"Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.",human
"This study proposes Tool-RoCo, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-term multi-agent cooperation based on RoCo, a multi-robot cooperative benchmark. Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has relied on predefined orchestration, while ignoring agent autonomy. Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization. Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls. Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage. The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants. Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination. Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks. Code and Demo: https://github.com/ColaZhang22/Tool-Roco",human
"Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.",human
"We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",human
"Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.",human
"The widespread use of neural surrogates in automotive aerodynamics, enabled by datasets such as DrivAerML and DrivAerNet++, has primarily focused on bluff-body flows with large wakes. Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration. To facilitate future research, we open-source our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EmmiAI/Emmi-Wing.",human
"Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.",human
"Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.",human
"We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.",human
"Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.",human
"Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.",human
"Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.",human
"Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress.

"Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EvRainDrop.",human
"Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.",human
"Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.",human
"We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel ""Latent Action Energy"" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.",human
"Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAM_ChangeCaptioning",human
"In pseudo-boolean solving the currently most successful unit propagation strategy is a hybrid mode combining the watched literal scheme with the counting method. This short paper introduces new heuristics for this hybrid decision, which are able to drastically outperform the current method in the RoundingSAT solver.",human
"Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.",human
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.",human
"Due to rising demands for Artificial Inteligence (AI) inference, especially in higher education, novel solutions utilising existing infrastructure are emerging. The utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has become a prevalent approach for the implementation of such solutions. However, the classical operating model of HPC does not adapt well to the requirements of synchronous, user-facing dynamic AI application workloads. In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.",human
"The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.",human
"Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.",human
"Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.",human
"Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected ""thoughts"" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting ""thoughts"" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether ""training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences."" We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.",human
"Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.",human
"How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.",human
"""Thinking with images"" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning. Our model, data, and code are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/Monet.",human
"Reranking improves recommendation quality by modeling item interactions. However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss. Deployed in Meituan advertising system, RIA yields a +1.69% improvement in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and a +4.54% increase in Cost Per Mille (CPM) in online A/B tests.",human
"Online platforms usually suffer from user experience degradation due to near-duplicate items with similar visuals and text. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable multimodal embedding, existing methods treat representations as black boxes, ignoring structural relationships (e.g., primary vs. auxiliary elements), leading to local structural collapse problem. To address this, inspired by Feature Integration Theory (FIT), we propose FITRep, the first attention-guided, white-box item representation framework for fine-grained item deduplication. FITRep consists of: (1) Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction (CHIE), using MLLMs to extract hierarchical semantic concepts; (2) Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction (SPDR), an adaptive UMAP-based method for efficient information compression; and (3) FAISS-Based Clustering (FBC), a FAISS-based clustering that assigns each item a unique cluster id using FAISS. Deployed on Meituan's advertising system, FITRep achieves +3.60% CTR and +4.25% CPM gains in online A/B tests, demonstrating both effectiveness and real-world impact.",human
"Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.",human
"Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.",human
"Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.",human
"Numerical simulations provide key insights into many physical, real-world problems. However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.",human
"Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.",human
"The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.",human
"Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.",human
"Machine learning (ML) is increasingly adopted in scientific research, yet the quality and reliability of results often depend on how experiments are designed and documented. Poor baselines, inconsistent preprocessing, or insufficient validation can lead to misleading conclusions about model performance. This paper presents a practical and structured guide for conducting ML experiments in scientific applications, focussing on reproducibility, fair comparison, and transparent reporting. We outline a step-by-step workflow, from dataset preparation to model selection and evaluation, and propose metrics that account for overfitting and instability across validation folds, including the Logarithmic Overfitting Ratio (LOR) and the Composite Overfitting Score (COS). Through recommended practices and example reporting formats, this work aims to support researchers in establishing robust baselines and drawing valid evidence-based insights from ML models applied to scientific problems.",human
"Higher-order networks, naturally described as hypergraphs, are essential for modeling real-world systems involving interactions among three or more entities. Stochastic block models offer a principled framework for characterizing mesoscale organization, yet their extension to hypergraphs involves a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. A recent simplification, a single-order model, mitigates this complexity by assuming a single affinity pattern governs interactions of all orders. This universal assumption, however, may overlook order-dependent structural details. Here, we propose a framework that relaxes this assumption by introducing a multi-order block structure, in which different affinity patterns govern distinct subsets of interaction orders. Our framework is based on a multi-order stochastic block model and searches for the optimal partition of the set of interaction orders that maximizes out-of-sample hyperlink prediction performance. Analyzing a diverse range of real-world networks, we find that multi-order block structures are prevalent. Accounting for them not only yields better predictive performance over the single-order model but also uncovers sharper, more interpretable mesoscale organization. Our findings reveal that order-dependent mechanisms are a key feature of the mesoscale organization of real-world higher-order networks.",human
"Separating the individual elements in a musical mixture is an essential process for music analysis and practice. While this is generally addressed using neural networks optimized to mask or transform the time-frequency representation of a mixture to extract the target sources, the flexibility and generalization capabilities of generative diffusion models are giving rise to a novel class of solutions for this complicated task. In this work, we explore singing voice separation from real music recordings using a diffusion model which is trained to generate the solo vocals conditioned on the corresponding mixture. Our approach improves upon prior generative systems and achieves competitive objective scores against non-generative baselines when trained with supplementary data. The iterative nature of diffusion sampling enables the user to control the quality-efficiency trade-off, and also refine the output when needed. We present an ablation study of the sampling algorithm, highlighting the effects of the user-configurable parameters.",human
"This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.",human
"Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.",human
"Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.",human
"This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.",human
"Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated unparalleled sampling quality and diversity in numerous fields, such as image generation, voice synthesis, and tabular data synthesis, etc. Inspired by those outstanding results, we apply SGMs to synthesize time-series by learning its conditional score function. To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.",human
"We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.",human
"Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.",human
"Deepfake (DF) audio detectors still struggle to generalize to out of distribution inputs. A central reason is spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency structure before high-frequency (HF) details, which both causes DF generators to leave HF artifacts and leaves those same artifacts under-exploited by common detectors. To address this gap, we propose Spectral-cONtrastive Audio Residuals (SONAR), a frequency-guided framework that explicitly disentangles an audio signal into complementary representations. An XLSR encoder captures the dominant low-frequency content, while the same cloned path, preceded by learnable SRM, value-constrained high-pass filters, distills faint HF residuals. Frequency cross-attention reunites the two views for long- and short-range frequency dependencies, and a frequency-aware Jensen-Shannon contrastive loss pulls real content-noise pairs together while pushing fake embeddings apart, accelerating optimization and sharpening decision boundaries. Evaluated on the ASVspoof 2021 and in-the-wild benchmarks, SONAR attains state-of-the-art performance and converges four times faster than strong baselines. By elevating faint high-frequency residuals to first-class learning signals, SONAR unveils a fully data-driven, frequency-guided contrastive framework that splits the latent space into two disjoint manifolds: natural-HF for genuine audio and distorted-HF for synthetic audio, thereby sharpening decision boundaries. Because the scheme operates purely at the representation level, it is architecture-agnostic and, in future work, can be seamlessly integrated into any model or modality where subtle high-frequency cues are decisive.",human
"Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.",human
"Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate synthetic timeseries data to help improve the performance of a classifier, but their sampling process is computationally expensive. We address this by combining implicit diffusion models with a novel Sawtooth Sampler that accelerates the reverse process and can be applied to any pretrained diffusion model. Our approach achieves a 30 times speed-up over the standard baseline while also enhancing the quality of the generated sequences for classification tasks.",human
"Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.",human
"We study the periodic behaviour of the dual logarithmic derivative operator $\mathcal{A}[f]=\mathrm{d}\ln f/\mathrm{d}\ln x$ in a complex analytic setting. We show that $\mathcal{A}$ admits genuinely nondegenerate period-$2$ orbits and identify a canonical explicit example. Motivated by this, we obtain a complete classification of all nondegenerate period-$2$ solutions, which are precisely the rational pairs $(c a x^{c}/(1-ax^{c}),\, c/(1-ax^{c}))$ with $ac\neq 0$. We further classify all fixed points of $\mathcal{A}$, showing that every solution of $\mathcal{A}[f]=f$ has the form $f(x)=1/(a-\ln x)$. As an illustration, logistic-type functions become pre-periodic under $\mathcal{A}$ after a logarithmic change of variables, entering the period-$2$ family in one iterate. These results give an explicit description of the low-period structure of $\mathcal{A}$ and provide a tractable example of operator-induced dynamics on function spaces.",human
"This paper proposes a new strategy for collision avoidance system leveraging Time-to-Collision (TTC) metrics for handling cut-in scenarios, which are particularly challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs). By integrating a deep learning with TTC calculations, the system predicts potential collisions and determines appropriate evasive actions compared to traditional TTC -based approaches.",human
"Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.",human
"Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.",human
"Post-Double-Lasso is becoming the most popular method for estimating linear regression models with many covariates when the purpose is to obtain an accurate estimate of a parameter of interest, such as an average treatment effect. However, this method can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias in finite sample. We propose a new method called Post-Double-Autometrics, which is based on Autometrics, and show that this method outperforms Post-Double-Lasso. Its use in a standard application of economic growth sheds new light on the hypothesis of convergence from poor to rich economies.",human
"This paper introduces The Spheres dataset, multitrack orchestral recordings designed to advance machine learning research in music source separation and related MIR tasks within the classical music domain. The dataset is composed of over one hour recordings of musical pieces performed by the Colibrì Ensemble at The Spheres recording studio, capturing two canonical works - Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet and Mozart's Symphony No. 40 - along with chromatic scales and solo excerpts for each instrument. The recording setup employed 23 microphones, including close spot, main, and ambient microphones, enabling the creation of realistic stereo mixes with controlled bleeding and providing isolated stems for supervised training of source separation models. In addition, room impulse responses were estimated for each instrument position, offering valuable acoustic characterization of the recording space. We present the dataset structure, acoustic analysis, and baseline evaluations using X-UMX based models for orchestral family separation and microphone debleeding. Results highlight both the potential and the challenges of source separation in complex orchestral scenarios, underscoring the dataset's value for benchmarking and for exploring new approaches to separation, localization, dereverberation, and immersive rendering of classical music.",human
"The increasing demand for on-device intelligence in Edge AI and TinyML applications requires the efficient execution of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2 employ Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC) to reduce computational complexity, their multi-stage design introduces a critical performance bottleneck inherent to layer-by-layer execution: the high energy and latency cost of transferring intermediate feature maps to either large on-chip buffers or off-chip DRAM. To address this memory wall, this paper introduces a novel hardware accelerator architecture that utilizes a fused pixel-wise dataflow. Implemented as a Custom Function Unit (CFU) for a RISC-V processor, our architecture eliminates the need for intermediate buffers entirely, reducing the data movement up to 87\% compared to conventional layer-by-layer execution. It computes a single output pixel to completion across all DSC stages-expansion, depthwise convolution, and projection-by streaming data through a tightly-coupled pipeline without writing to memory. Evaluated on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, our design achieves a speedup of up to 59.3x over the baseline software execution on the RISC-V core. Furthermore, ASIC synthesis projects a compact 0.284 mm$^2$ footprint with 910 mW power at 2 GHz in 28 nm, and a 1.20 mm$^2$ footprint with 233 mW power at 300 MHz in 40 nm. This work confirms the feasibility of a zero-buffer dataflow within a TinyML resource envelope, offering a novel and effective strategy for overcoming the memory wall in edge AI accelerators.",human
"This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.",human
"Variational inference (VI) is a cornerstone of modern Bayesian learning, enabling approximate inference in complex models that would otherwise be intractable. However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.",human
"There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.",human
"We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.",human
"Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.",human
"Thermoelectrics (TEs) are promising candidates for energy harvesting with performance quantified by figure of merit, $ZT$. To accelerate the discovery of high-$ZT$ materials, efforts have focused on identifying compounds with low thermal conductivity $κ$. Using a curated dataset of 71,913 entries, we show that high-$ZT$ materials reside not only in the low-$κ$ regime but also cluster near a lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio ($κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$) of approximately 0.5, consistent with the phonon-glass electron-crystal design concept. Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $κ$ and $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$κ$ candidates. Follow-up case studies demonstrate that this framework can reliably provide optimization strategies by suggesting new dopants and alloys that shift pristine materials toward the $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ approaching 0.5 regime. Ultimately, by integrating rapid screening with PGEC-guided optimization, our data-driven framework effectively bridges the critical gap between materials discovery and performance enhancement.",human
"Gene prioritization (identifying genes potentially associated with a biological process) is increasingly tackled with Artificial Intelligence. However, existing methods struggle with the high dimensionality and incomplete labelling of biomedical data. This work proposes a more robust and efficient pipeline that leverages Fast-mRMR feature selection to retain only relevant, non-redundant features for classifiers. This enables us to build simpler and more effective models, as well as to combine different biological feature sets. Experiments on Dietary Restriction datasets show significant improvements over existing methods, proving that feature selection can be critical for reliable gene prioritization.",human
"Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.",human
"Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.",human
"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.",human
"Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., ""shape"", ""color""), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhengli97/ATPrompt.",human
"Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.",human
"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.",human
"Diffusion models exhibit notable fragility when faced with adversarial prompts, and strengthening attack capabilities is crucial for uncovering such vulnerabilities and building more robust generative systems. Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.",human
"Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.",human
"Non-contact manipulation has emerged as a transformative approach across various industrial fields. However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.",human
"Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.",human
"Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical ""brain-action"" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

"Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.",human
"Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.   We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.   VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.",human
"Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

"Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.",human
"This paper investigates the partial linear model by Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression. We parameterize the nonparametric term using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and formulate a penalized LAD problem for estimation. Specifically, our model exhibits the following challenges. First, the regularization term can be nonconvex and nonsmooth, necessitating the introduction of infinite dimensional variational analysis and nonsmooth analysis into the asymptotic normality discussion. Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation. We study the convergence of a proximal subgradient method for both formulations, highlighting their structural differences lead to distinct computational subproblems along the iterations. In particular, the relaxed formulation admits significantly cheaper proximal updates, reflecting an inherent trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational tractability.",human
"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.",human
"Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.",human
"Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.",human
"Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.",human
"Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically ""sculpts"" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.",human
"Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the ""user-item decoupling"" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.",human
"Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

"This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.",human
"Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography (""data"", ""poop"", ""loll"": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.",human
"In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.",human
"Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.",human
"Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.",human
"Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses ""minimum group confidence"" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.",human
"Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance. The experiment code is available at: https://github.com/wllchrst/sarcasm-detection_pmp_knowledge-base.",human
"Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",human
"We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/GNet2025/GNet.",human
"Zipf's law in language lacks a definitive origin, debated across fields. This study explains Zipf-like behavior using geometric mechanisms without linguistic elements. The Full Combinatorial Word Model (FCWM) forms words from a finite alphabet, generating a geometric distribution of word lengths. Interacting exponential forces yield a power-law rank-frequency curve, determined by alphabet size and blank symbol probability. Simulations support predictions, matching English, Russian, and mixed-genre data. The symbolic model suggests Zipf-type laws arise from geometric constraints, not communicative efficiency.",human
"Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.",human
"Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.",human
"Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.",human
"Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.",human
"Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.",human
"Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

"Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.",human
"The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.",human
"Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search. Code is available at https://github.com/FuCongResearchSquad/ELBO4TDS.",human
"Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.",human
"Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.",human
"As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.",human
"Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.",human
"The challenge of separating AI-generated text from human-authored content is becoming more urgent as generative AI technologies like ChatGPT become more widely available. In this work, we address this issue by looking at both the detection of content that has been entirely generated by AI and the identification of human text that has been reworded by AI. In our work, a comprehensive methodology to detect AI- generated text using XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual transformer model. Our approach includes rigorous preprocessing, and feature extraction involving perplexity, semantic, and readability features. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model on a balanced dataset of human and AI-generated texts and evaluated its performance. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance across various text genres. Additionally, we conducted feature analysis to understand the model's decision-making process, revealing that perplexity and attention-based features are critical in differentiating between human and AI-generated texts. Our findings offer a valuable tool for maintaining academic integrity and contribute to the broader field of AI ethics by promoting transparency and accountability in AI systems. Future research directions include exploring other advanced models and expanding the dataset to enhance the model's generalizability.",human
"We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.",human
"Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.",human
"News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.",human
"Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.",human
"Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game ""Crafter"" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",human
"Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

"Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.",human
"Evolutionary program synthesis systems such as AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, and ShinkaEvolve offer a new approach to AI-assisted mathematical discovery. These systems utilize teams of large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate solutions to a problem as human readable code. These candidate solutions are then 'evolved' with the goal of improving them beyond what an LLM can produce in a single shot. While existing mathematical applications have mostly focused on problems of establishing bounds (e.g., sphere packing), the program synthesis approach is well suited to any problem where the solution takes the form of an explicit construction. With this in mind, in this paper we explore the use of OpenEvolve for combinatorial bijection discovery. We describe the results of applying OpenEvolve to three bijection construction problems involving Dyck paths, two of which are known and one of which is open. We find that while systems like OpenEvolve show promise as a valuable tool for combinatorialists, the problem of finding novel, research-level bijections remains a challenging task for current frontier systems, reinforcing the need for human mathematicians in the loop. We describe some lessons learned for others in the field interested in exploring the use of these systems.",human
"Efficiency and reliability are both crucial for energy management, especially in multi-microgrid systems (MMSs) integrating intermittent and distributed renewable energy sources. This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.",human
"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping how we approach scientific discovery, not by replacing established methods but by extending what researchers can probe, predict, and design. In this roadmap we provide a forward-looking view of AI-enabled science across biology, chemistry, climate science, mathematics, materials science, physics, self-driving laboratories and unconventional computing. Several shared themes emerge: the need for diverse and trustworthy data, transferable electronic-structure and interatomic models, AI systems integrated into end-to-end scientific workflows that connect simulations to experiments and generative systems grounded in synthesisability rather than purely idealised phases. Across domains, we highlight how large foundation models, active learning and self-driving laboratories can close loops between prediction and validation while maintaining reproducibility and physical interpretability. Taken together, these perspectives outline where AI-enabled science stands today, identify bottlenecks in data, methods and infrastructure, and chart concrete directions for building AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more transparent and capable of accelerating discovery in complex real-world environments.",human
"The scarcity of parallel speech corpora critically hampers speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), often forcing reliance on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.",human
"Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.   In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.",human
"Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.",human
"Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.",human
"Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain. We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions.   Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\% of errors while deferring 34.5\% of samples. Notably, this operational gain is achievable with any well-calibrated probability output; the contribution of geometric calibration lies in its theoretical foundations rather than empirical superiority over simpler alternatives. This work bridges information geometry and statistical learning, offering formal guarantees relevant to applications requiring rigorous validation.",human
"Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Analytical results reveal a statistically significant positive correlation between negative affective states and commit frequency, implying a cycle of iterative remediation driven by frustration. Furthermore, the investigation has demonstrated that analyzing the topology of contributor interactions yields superior fidelity in mapping collaborative dynamics compared to traditional volume-based metrics.

"Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).   This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.",human
"The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces major challenges for decentralized charging control. Existing decentralized approaches efficiently coordinate a large number of EVs to select charging stations while reducing energy costs, preventing power peak and preserving driver privacy. However, they often struggle under severe contingencies, such as station outages or unexpected surges in charging requests. These situations create competition for limited charging slots, resulting in long queues and reduced driver comfort. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collective learning-based coordination framework that allows EVs to balance individual comfort on their selections against system-wide efficiency, i.e., the overall queues across all stations. In the framework, EVs are recommended for adaptive charging behaviors that shift priority between comfort and efficiency, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying station capacities and dynamic spatio-temporal EV distribution. Experiments using real-world data from EVs and charging stations show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, significantly reducing travel and queuing time. The results reveal that, under uncertain charging conditions, EV drivers that behave selfishly or altruistically at the right moments achieve shorter waiting time than those maintaining moderate behavior throughout. Our findings under high fractions of station outages and adversarial EVs further demonstrate improved resilience and trustworthiness of decentralized EV charging infrastructure.",human
"In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for ""how"" and ""why"" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.",human
"Two-sample tests have been extensively employed in various scientific fields and machine learning such as evaluation on the effectiveness of drugs and A/B testing on different marketing strategies to discriminate whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution or not. Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios.

"Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.",human
"Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

"While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.",human
"Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.",human
"Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.",human
"Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.",human
"Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.",human
"Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.",human
"Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.",human
"Diffusion- and flow-based policies deliver state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon robotic manipulation and imitation learning tasks. However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.",human

The methodology combines a structured literature review with exploratory interviews conducted with professionals from the banking sector. The results show that fraud schemes have evolved from purely social engineering approaches to hybrid strategies that integrate human manipulation with technical exploitation. The study concludes that security measures must advance at the same pace as the growing complexity of attack methodologies, with particular emphasis on adaptive defenses and continuous user awareness.",human
"We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table). Supplementary materials are at https://github.com/aodongli/probabilistic-hash-embeddings",human
"Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.",human
"Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.",human
"This paper argues that DNNs implement a computational Occam's razor -- finding the `simplest' algorithm that fits the data -- and that this could explain their incredible and wide-ranging success over more traditional statistical methods. We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $ε$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $cε^{-γ}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $γ>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.",human
"Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.",human
"Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.",human
"The new educational models such as smart learning environments use of digital and context-aware devices to facilitate the learning process. In this new educational scenario, a huge quantity of multimodal students' data from a variety of different sources can be captured, fused, and analyze.

"State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.   In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.",human

"Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.",human
"Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.",human
"Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.",human
"Feature selection has remained a daunting challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where increasingly complex, high-dimensional datasets demand principled strategies for isolating the most informative predictors. Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.",human
"We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.",human

"Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.",human
"The home space for optimal control is a Sobolev space. The home space for pseudospectral theory is also a Sobolev space. It thus seems natural to combine pseudospectral theory with optimal control theory and construct ``pseudospectral optimal control theory,'' a term coined by Ross. In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems.",human
"We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

"As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).",human
"Sparse Convolution (SpC) powers 3D point cloud networks widely used in autonomous driving and AR/VR. SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.",human
"The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling. The source code and additional visual results are available at https://github.com/rezmansouri/solarwind-sfno-velocity-autoregressive.",human
"Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.",human
"Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.",human
"Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

"We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.",human
"We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.",human
"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.",human
"Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.",human
"Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute ""delta"" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.",human
"Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.",human
"Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors. The code is available at: https://github.com/xiaojiao929/MTI-Net.",human
"Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.",human
"Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/",human
"Traditional object detection models in medical imaging operate within a closed-set paradigm, limiting their ability to detect objects of novel labels. Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection.

"What data should a vision-language model be trained on? To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i) Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii) Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models. Overall, CABS represents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks.",human
"Long-tailed multi-label visual recognition poses a significant challenge, as images typically contain multiple labels with highly imbalanced class distributions, leading to biased models that favor head classes while underperforming on tail classes. Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmarks including VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that CAPNET achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world long-tailed multi-label visual recognition.",human
"While generative video models have achieved remarkable fidelity and consistency, applying these capabilities to video editing remains a complex challenge. Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a ""motion edit"" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating ""motion counterfactuals"", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

"Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

"Mechanical design and manufacturing workflows conventionally begin with conceptual design, followed by the creation of a computer-aided design (CAD) model and fabrication through material-extrusion (MEX) printing. This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing.",human
"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with reward models has advanced alignment of generative models to human aesthetic and perceptual preferences. However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively.

"The integration of AI components, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), into safety-critical systems such as aerospace and autonomous vehicles presents fundamental challenges for assurance. The opacity of AI systems, combined with the semantic gap between high-level requirements and low-level network representations, creates barriers to traditional verification approaches. These AI-specific challenges are amplified by longstanding issues in Requirements Engineering, including ambiguity in natural language specifications and scalability bottlenecks in formalization. We propose an approach that leverages AI itself to address these challenges through two complementary components. REACT (Requirements Engineering with AI for Consistency and Testing) employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between informal natural language requirements and formal specifications, enabling early verification and validation. SemaLens (Semantic Analysis of Visual Perception using large Multi-modal models) utilizes Vision Language Models (VLMs) to reason about, test, and monitor DNN-based perception systems using human-understandable concepts. Together, these components provide a comprehensive pipeline from informal requirements to validated implementations.",human
"The optimization of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly as model scaling exacerbates sensitivity to algorithmic imprecision and training instability. Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training.

This paper introduce an open-source copyright detection platform that enables content creators to verify whether their work was used in LLM training datasets. Our approach enhances existing methodologies by facilitating ease of use, improving similarity detection, optimizing dataset validation, and reducing computational overhead by 10-30% with efficient API calls.

"As demand for LLM inference grows, it is becoming increasingly important that providers and their customers can verify that inference processes are performed correctly, without errors or tampering. However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods. We release an open-source integration with vLLM to accelerate practical deployment of verifiable inference.",human
"This study aimed to explore the application of deep neural networks for whole-body human posture prediction during dynamic load-reaching activities. Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model. This study merits the use of neural networks that capture time series dependencies in 3D motion frames, providing a unique approach for understanding and predict motion dynamics during manual material handling activities.",human
"The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI-assisted code generation. This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios.",human
"Many consequential real-world systems, like wind fields and ocean currents, are dynamic and hard to model. Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.",human
"We introduce and analyse active learning markets as a way to purchase labels, in situations where analysts aim to acquire additional data to improve model fitting, or to better train models for predictive analytics applications. This comes in contrast to the many proposals that already exist to purchase features and examples. By originally formalising the market clearing as an optimisation problem, we integrate budget constraints and improvement thresholds into the label acquisition process. We focus on a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup and propose the use of two active learning strategies (variance based and query-by-committee based), paired with distinct pricing mechanisms. They are compared to a benchmark random sampling approach. The proposed strategies are validated on real-world datasets from two critical application domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Results demonstrate the robustness of our approach, consistently achieving superior performance with fewer labels acquired compared to conventional methods. Our proposal comprises an easy-to-implement practical solution for optimising data acquisition in resource-constrained environments.",human
"Alignment with human preferences is an important evaluation aspect of LLMs, requiring them to be helpful, honest, safe, and to precisely follow human instructions. Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.",human
"Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.",human
"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into web browsers introduces security challenges that go beyond traditional web application threat models. Prior work has identified prompt injection as a new attack vector for web agents, yet the resulting impact within real-world environments remains insufficiently understood.   In this work, we examine the landscape of prompt injection attacks and synthesize a benchmark of attacks embedded in realistic HTML payloads. Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models. We propose a multi-layered defense strategy comprising both architectural and model-based defenses to protect against evolving prompt injection attacks. Our work offers a blueprint for designing practical, secure web agents through a defense-in-depth approach.",human
"The recovery of training data from generative models (``model inversion'') has been extensively studied for diffusion models in the data domain. The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization. Empirically, removing less-memorizing dimensions when computing attack statistics for score-based membership inference attacker significantly improves performance, with average AUROC gains of 2.7\% and substantial increases in TPR@1\%FPR (6.42\%) across diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-1K, Pokémon, MS-COCO, and Flickr. This indicates stronger confidence in identifying members under extremely low false-positive tolerance. Our results highlight the overlooked influence of the auto-encoder geometry on LDM memorization and provide a new perspective for analyzing privacy risks in diffusion-based generative models.",human
"The learning process of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent remains poorly understood beyond the mathematical formulation of its learning algorithm. To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations. Overall, we believe that ATOM could help improve our understanding of the learning processes of RL agents and better understand the relationship between attention and learning.",human
"Microgrids are deployed to reduce purchased grid energy, limit exposure to volatile tariffs, and ensure service continuity during disturbances. This requires coordinating heterogeneous distributed energy resources across multiple time scales and under variable conditions. Among existing tools, typically, power-system simulators capture physical behaviour but assume centralized control, while multi-agent frameworks model decentralized decision-making but represent energy with no physical grounding. In this context, the EnergyTwin is introduced, an agent-based microgrid simulation environment that couples physically grounded models with forecast-informed, rolling-horizon planning, and negotiations. Each asset is modeled as an agent, interacting with a central agent that obtains forecasts, formulates predictions, and allocates energy through contract-based interactions. EnergyTwin targets tertiary-layer decision making and is extensible for digital-twin use. Its feasibility was evaluated in a university campus microgrid scenario where multiple planning strategies were compared. Achieved results show that forecast-driven rolling-horizon planning increases local energy self-sufficiency, maintains higher battery reserves, and reduces exposure to low-resilience operating states. They demonstrate also potential of EnergyTwin as platform supporting research on resilient, negotiation-driven microgrids.",human
"We present Anatomica: an inference-time framework for generating multi-class anatomical voxel maps with localized geo-topological control. During generation, we use cuboidal control domains of varying dimensionality, location, and shape to slice out relevant substructures. These local substructures are used to compute differentiable penalty functions that steer the sample towards target constraints. We control geometric features such as size, shape, and position through voxel-wise moments, while topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids are enforced through persistent homology. Lastly, we implement Anatomica for latent diffusion models, where neural field decoders partially extract substructures, enabling the efficient control of anatomical properties. Anatomica applies flexibly across diverse anatomical systems, composing constraints to control complex structures over arbitrary dimensions and coordinate systems, thereby enabling the rational design of synthetic datasets for virtual trials or machine learning workflows.",human
"Trustworthiness has become a key requirement for the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in safety-critical applications. Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS), a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through Trust Nodes and Trust Functions that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a Parameter Trust Update mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA) method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a principled foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle.",human
"Adaptive optimizers can reduce to normalized steepest descent (NSD) when only adapting to the current gradient, suggesting a close connection between the two algorithmic families. A key distinction between their analyses, however, lies in the geometries, e.g., smoothness notions, they rely on. In the convex setting, adaptive optimizers are governed by a stronger adaptive smoothness condition, while NSD relies on the standard notion of smoothness. We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry. We further develop an analogous comparison for stochastic optimization by introducing adaptive gradient variance, which parallels adaptive smoothness and leads to dimension-free convergence guarantees that cannot be achieved under standard gradient variance for certain non-Euclidean geometry.",human
"Real-world time-series data is highly non stationary and complex in dynamics that operate across multiple timescales, ranging from fast, short-term changes to slow, long-term trends. Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST. In total, MSTN establishes new SOTA performance on 24 of 32 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its consistent performance across diverse temporal tasks.",human
"Safety-critical assistive systems that directly decode user intent from neural signals require rigorous guarantees of reliability and trust. We present GUARDIAN (Gated Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Dual Invariants), a framework for real-time neuro-symbolic verification for neural signal-controlled robotics. GUARDIAN enforces both logical safety and physiological trust by coupling confidence-calibrated brain signal decoding with symbolic goal grounding and dual-layer runtime monitoring. On the BNCI2014 motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset with 9 subjects and 5,184 trials, the system performs at a high safety rate of 94-97% even with lightweight decoder architectures with low test accuracies (27-46%) and high ECE confidence miscalibration (0.22-0.41). We demonstrate 1.7x correct interventions in simulated noise testing versus at baseline. The monitor operates at 100Hz and sub-millisecond decision latency, making it practically viable for closed-loop neural signal-based systems. Across 21 ablation results, GUARDIAN exhibits a graduated response to signal degradation, and produces auditable traces from intent, plan to action, helping to link neural evidence to verifiable robot action.",human
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.",human
"Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

"The abundance of fine-grained spatio-temporal data, such as traffic sensor networks, offers vast opportunities for scientific discovery. However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.",human
"Passive acoustic mapping enables the spatial mapping and temporal monitoring of cavitation activity, playing a crucial role in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods. This highlights the substantial gain in data efficiency and the flexibility of our spatiotemporal regularization to adapt to diverse passive cavitation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.",human
"Diffusion Models have emerged as a leading class of generative models, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally expensive. Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics. Our work presents an effective paradigm for training efficient, high-fidelity, and stable generative models. Codes are coming soon.",human
"Identifying discourse features in student conversations is quite important for educational researchers to recognize the curricular and pedagogical variables that cause students to engage in constructing knowledge rather than merely completing tasks. The manual analysis of student conversations to identify these discourse features is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which limits the scale and scope of studies. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights. However, existing studies in NLP that focus on discourse in dialogue rarely address educational data. In this work, we address this gap by introducing an annotated educational dialogue dataset of student conversations featuring knowledge construction and task production discourse. We also establish baseline models for automatically predicting these discourse properties for each turn of talk within conversations, using pre-trained large language models GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1. Experimental results indicate that these state-of-the-art models perform suboptimally on this task, indicating the potential for future research.",human
"While olfaction is central to how animals perceive the world, this rich chemical sensory modality remains largely inaccessible to machines. One key bottleneck is the lack of diverse, multimodal olfactory training data collected in natural settings. We present New York Smells, a large dataset of paired image and olfactory signals captured ``in the wild.'' Our dataset contains 7,000 smell-image pairs from 3,500 distinct objects across indoor and outdoor environments, with approximately 70$\times$ more objects than existing olfactory datasets. Our benchmark has three tasks: cross-modal smell-to-image retrieval, recognizing scenes, objects, and materials from smell alone, and fine-grained discrimination between grass species. Through experiments on our dataset, we find that visual data enables cross-modal olfactory representation learning, and that our learned olfactory representations outperform widely-used hand-crafted features.",human
"The UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) extends the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by incorporating a parallel UNet pathway, enabling the retention of both high- and low-frequency components. While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions. Our experiments on subsurface multiphase flow demonstrate a 21\% reduction in gas saturation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to UFNO, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy.",human
"This paper addresses the critical need for automated crack detection in the preservation of cultural heritage through semantic segmentation. We present a comparative study of U-Net architectures, using various convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders, for pixel-level crack identification on statues and monuments. A comparative quantitative evaluation is performed on the test set of the OmniCrack30k dataset [1] using popular segmentation metrics including Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index. This is complemented by an out-of-distribution qualitative evaluation on an unlabeled test set of real-world cracked statues and monuments. Our findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of different CNN- based encoders for fine-grained crack segmentation. We show that the models exhibit promising generalization capabilities to unseen cultural heritage contexts, despite never having been explicitly trained on images of statues or monuments.",human

"Modern machine learning models for audio tasks often exhibit superior performance on English and other well-resourced languages, primarily due to the abundance of available training data. This disparity leads to an unfair performance gap for low-resource languages, where data collection is both challenging and costly. In this work, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique for speech corpora designed to mitigate this gap. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of automatic speech recognition systems on low-resource languages. Furthermore, we show that our approach outperforms existing augmentation strategies, offering a practical solution for enhancing speech technology in underrepresented linguistic communities.",human
"The primary output of the nervous system is movement and behavior. While recent advances have democratized pose tracking during complex behavior, kinematic trajectories alone provide only indirect access to the underlying control processes. Here we present MIMIC-MJX, a framework for learning biologically-plausible neural control policies from kinematics. MIMIC-MJX models the generative process of motor control by training neural controllers that learn to actuate biomechanically-realistic body models in physics simulation to reproduce real kinematic trajectories. We demonstrate that our implementation is accurate, fast, data-efficient, and generalizable to diverse animal body models. Policies trained with MIMIC-MJX can be utilized to both analyze neural control strategies and simulate behavioral experiments, illustrating its potential as an integrative modeling framework for neuroscience.",human
"Visual Language Models (VLMs) are powerful generative tools but often produce factually inaccurate outputs due to a lack of robust reasoning capabilities. While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. We evaluate the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations, analyzing their effectiveness in factual accuracy and logical inference. Empirical results show that our approach improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on preliminary experiments on a curated dataset of mixtures from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual captions and Coco captions revealing key insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgable multimodal systems.",human
"Background: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into digital health education and assessment workflows, their capabilities in supporting high-stakes, domain-specific certification tasks remain underexplored.In China, the national pharmacist licensure exam serves as a standardized benchmark for evaluating pharmacists' clinical and theoretical competencies. Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts.",human
"The Adam optimizer is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, yet the empirical necessity of each of its individual components is often taken for granted. This paper presents a focused investigation into the role of bias-correction, a feature whose contribution remains poorly understood. Through a series of systematic ablations on vision and language modelling tasks, we demonstrate that the conventional wisdom surrounding bias correction is misleading. In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $β_1, β_2 \in [0,1)$. Our findings challenge the universal inclusion of this component.",human
"Generative models, such as large language models and text-to-image diffusion models, are increasingly used to create visual designs like user interfaces (UIs) and presentation slides. Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples. Our work provides the first dataset to study personalized visual design evaluation and support future research into modeling individual design taste.",human
"Molecule generation using generative AI is vital for drug discovery, yet class-specific datasets often contain fewer than 100 training examples. While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a ""vocabulary selection"" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines. Furthermore, the fully autonomous Agent-Agent system outperformed traditional Human-Human tuning, demonstrating the efficacy of agentic tuning in capturing expert intent.",human
"Adaptive optimizers are the de facto standard in non-private training as they often enable faster convergence and improved performance. In contrast, differentially private (DP) training is still predominantly performed with DP-SGD, typically requiring extensive compute and hyperparameter tuning. We propose DP-MicroAdam, a memory-efficient and sparsity-aware adaptive DP optimizer. We prove that DP-MicroAdam converges in stochastic non-convex optimization at the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, up to privacy-dependent constants. Empirically, DP-MicroAdam outperforms existing adaptive DP optimizers and achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to DP-SGD across a range of benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, large-scale ImageNet training, and private fine-tuning of pretrained transformers. These results demonstrate that adaptive optimization can improve both performance and stability under differential privacy.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate ""model organism"" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.",human
"Generative modeling is typically framed as learning mapping rules, but from an observer's perspective without access to these rules, the task manifests as disentangling the geometric support from the probability distribution. We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of ""Hyper-Generalization,"" achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion.",human
"Accurate extraction and segmentation of the cerebral arteries from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences is essential for developing reliable clinical management models of complex cerebrovascular diseases. Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging. The implementation of the proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/irfantahir301/Physicsis_loss.",human
"Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth, persistence, and adaptability. Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness. Across source to target transfers, the approach delivers improved detection scores with classical and deep baselines, demonstrating a scalable, explainable, and transferable solution for APT detection.",human
"To address the scarcity and privacy concerns of network traffic data, various generative models have been developed to produce synthetic traffic. However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation.",human
"We introduce the Adversarial Confusion Attack, a new class of threats against multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Applications include embedding adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.",human
"Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for biomedical reasoning, but current benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical workflows. Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively. Overall, MTBBench offers a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning, reliability, and tool-use with a focus on MTB environments in precision oncology.",human
"Real-world AI/ML workflows often apply inference computations to feature vectors joined from multiple datasets. To avoid the redundant AI/ML computations caused by repeated data records in the join's output, factorized ML has been proposed to decompose ML computations into sub-computations to be executed on each normalized dataset. However, there is insufficient discussion on how factorized ML could impact AI/ML inference over multi-way joins. To address the limitations, we propose a novel declarative InferF system, focusing on the factorization of arbitrary inference workflows represented as analyzable expressions over the multi-way joins. We formalize our problem to flexibly push down partial factorized computations to qualified nodes in the join tree to minimize the overall inference computation and join costs and propose two algorithms to resolve the problem: (1) a greedy algorithm based on a per-node cost function that estimates the influence on overall latency if a subset of factorized computations is pushed to a node, and (2) a genetic algorithm for iteratively enumerating and evaluating promising factorization plans. We implement InferF on Velox, an open-sourced database engine from Meta, evaluate it on real-world datasets, observed up to 11.3x speedups, and systematically summarized the factors that determine when factorized ML can benefit AI/ML inference workflows.",human
"Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term nature. Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.",human
"We introduce Nemotron-Parse-1.1, a lightweight document parsing and OCR model that advances the capabilities of its predecessor, Nemoretriever-Parse-1.0. Nemotron-Parse-1.1 delivers improved capabilities across general OCR, markdown formatting, structured table parsing, and text extraction from pictures, charts, and diagrams. It also supports a longer output sequence length for visually dense documents. As with its predecessor, it extracts bounding boxes of text segments, as well as corresponding semantic classes. Nemotron-Parse-1.1 follows an encoder-decoder architecture with 885M parameters, including a compact 256M-parameter language decoder. It achieves competitive accuracy on public benchmarks making it a strong lightweight OCR solution. We release the model weights publicly on Huggingface, as well as an optimized NIM container, along with a subset of the training data as part of the broader Nemotron-VLM-v2 dataset. Additionally, we release Nemotron-Parse-1.1-TC which operates on a reduced vision token length, offering a 20% speed improvement with minimal quality degradation.",human
"Developing comprehensive assistive technologies requires the seamless integration of visual and auditory perception. This research evaluates the feasibility of a modular architecture inspired by core functionalities of perceptive systems like 'Smart Eye.' We propose and benchmark three independent sensing modules: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for eye state detection (drowsiness/attention), a deep CNN for facial expression recognition, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for voice-based speaker identification. Utilizing the Eyes Image, FER2013, and customized audio datasets, our models achieved accuracies of 93.0%, 97.8%, and 96.89%, respectively. This study demonstrates that lightweight, domain-specific models can achieve high fidelity on discrete tasks, establishing a validated foundation for future real-time, multimodal integration in resource-constrained assistive devices.",human
"Reasoning based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention due to outstanding performance of these models in mathematical and complex logical tasks. Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \textit{combinational}, \textit{exploratory}, and \textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics. With a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning techniques as well as representative commercial models with reasoning capability, we show that UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning.",human
"Extracting individual elements from music mixtures is a valuable tool for music production and practice. While neural networks optimized to mask or transform mixture spectrograms into the individual source(s) have been the leading approach, the source overlap and correlation in music signals poses an inherent challenge. Also, accessing all sources in the mixture is crucial to train these systems, while complicated. Attempts to address these challenges in a generative fashion exist, however, the separation performance and inference efficiency remain limited. In this work, we study the potential of diffusion models to advance toward bridging this gap, focusing on generative singing voice separation relying only on corresponding pairs of isolated vocals and mixtures for training. To align with creative workflows, we leverage latent diffusion: the system generates samples encoded in a compact latent space, and subsequently decodes these into audio. This enables efficient optimization and faster inference. Our system is trained using only open data. We outperform existing generative separation systems, and level the compared non-generative systems on a list of signal quality measures and on interference removal. We provide a noise robustness study on the latent encoder, providing insights on its potential for the task. We release a modular toolkit for further research on the topic.",human
"Dance is an essential component of human culture and serves as a tool for conveying emotions and telling stories. Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain. The proposed approach achieves robust classification of different dance styles with low computational effort, as complex model architectures are not required, and shows that interpretable motion representations can effectively capture stylistic nuances.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-step reasoning and problem-solving.Recent works introduce multi-agent reflection frameworks where multiple LLM agents critique and refine each other's outputs using reinforcement learning (RL). However, these approaches often rely on single-shot responses and lack structural diversity in reasoning exploration. In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory. These selected drafts are used to refine future reasoning strategies through actor-critic learning.DRAFT-RL enables explicit multi-path exploration, peer-guided reflection, and reward-aligned selection, resulting in more robust and interpretable LLM agent behavior. We evaluate our method on complex reasoning tasks including code synthesis, symbolic math, and knowledge-intensive QA,demonstrating that DRAFT-RL outperforms existing reflective and RL-based agents by significant margins in both accuracy and convergence speed",human
"Normalizing flows (NFs) are end-to-end likelihood-based generative models for continuous data, and have recently regained attention with encouraging progress on image generation. Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models. Code and generated samples are available at https://github.com/apple/ml-starflow.",human
"Recent advances in large language models have created new opportunities for stylometry, the study of writing styles and authorship. Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation. Our findings show that the generated text reflects the authors' distinctive patterns and that AI-based evaluation offers a reliable alternative to human assessment. All artifacts of this work are published online.",human
"Modeling nonlinear systems with Volterra series is challenging because the number of kernel coefficients grows exponentially with the model order. This work introduces Bayesian Tensor Network Volterra kernel machines (BTN-V), extending the Bayesian Tensor Network framework to Volterra system identification. BTN-V represents Volterra kernels using canonical polyadic decomposition, reducing model complexity from O(I^D) to O(DIR). By treating all tensor components and hyperparameters as random variables, BTN-V provides predictive uncertainty estimation at no additional computational cost. Sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors enable automatic rank determination and the learning of fading-memory behavior directly from data, improving interpretability and preventing overfitting. Empirical results demonstrate competitive accuracy, enhanced uncertainty quantification, and reduced computational cost.",human
"Machine learning has become integral to Channel State Information (CSI)-based human sensing systems and is expected to power applications such as device-free activity recognition and identity detection in future cellular and Wi-Fi generations. However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.   This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems.",human
"Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.",human
"User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.",human
"In Vision Language Models (VLMs), vision tokens are quantity-heavy yet information-dispersed compared with language tokens, thus consume too much unnecessary computation. Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy. Our pruning also demonstrates interesting interpretability. Our codes are available at https://github.com/GarryLarry010131/OC-VTP.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are now deployed at unprecedented scale, assisting millions of users in daily tasks. However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored. In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs. Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior. Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases. Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance. Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts. On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications. On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance. Analysis of model reasoning traces suggests that model-perceived stereotypes, characterized along warmth and competence, are associated with the model's complicit behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient and may even exacerbate complicit behavior.",human
"Block-causal video generation faces a stark speed-quality trade-off: small 1.3B models manage only 16 FPS while large 14B models crawl at 4.5 FPS, forcing users to choose between responsiveness and quality. Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

"Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.",human
"Multi-object tracking (MOT) is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, where it is important to correctly detect objects and associate these detections across frames. Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.",human
"Text normalization is an essential preprocessing step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and stemming is one such normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form. However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).",human

"Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques.   In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks.   We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.",human
"Unit testing is an essential but resource-intensive step in software development, ensuring individual code units function correctly. This paper introduces AgoneTest, an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Model-generated (LLM) unit tests in Java. AgoneTest does not aim to propose a novel test generation algorithm; rather, it supports researchers and developers in comparing different LLMs and prompting strategies through a standardized end-to-end evaluation pipeline under realistic conditions. We introduce the Classes2Test dataset, which maps Java classes under test to their corresponding test classes, and a framework that integrates advanced evaluation metrics, such as mutation score and test smells, for a comprehensive assessment. Experimental results show that, for the subset of tests that compile, LLM-generated tests can match or exceed human-written tests in terms of coverage and defect detection. Our findings also demonstrate that enhanced prompting strategies contribute to test quality. AgoneTest clarifies the potential of LLMs in software testing and offers insights for future improvements in model design, prompt engineering, and testing practices.",human
"Large language models excel on broad multilingual benchmarks but remain to be evaluated extensively in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially in low-resource contexts. We present BengaliFig, a compact yet richly annotated challenge set that targets this gap in Bengali, a widely spoken low-resourced language. The dataset contains 435 unique riddles drawn from Bengali oral and literary traditions. Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation.",human
"We present BLINQ, a new model-based algorithm that learns the Whittle indices of an indexable, communicating and unichain Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach relies on building an empirical estimate of the MDP and then computing its Whittle indices using an extended version of a state-of-the-art existing algorithm. We provide a proof of convergence to the Whittle indices we want to learn as well as a bound on the time needed to learn them with arbitrary precision. Moreover, we investigate its computational complexity. Our numerical experiments suggest that BLINQ significantly outperforms existing Q-learning approaches in terms of the number of samples needed to get an accurate approximation. In addition, it has a total computational cost even lower than Q-learning for any reasonably high number of samples. These observations persist even when the Q-learning algorithms are speeded up using pre-trained neural networks to predict Q-values.",human
"Since 2012, tetrodotoxin (TTX) has been found in seafoods such as bivalve mollusks in temperate European waters. TTX contamination leads to food safety risks and economic losses, making early prediction of TTX contamination vital to the food industry and competent authorities. Recent studies have pointed to shallow habitats and water temperature as main drivers to TTX contamination in bivalve mollusks. However, the temporal relationships between abiotic factors, biotic factors, and TTX contamination remain unexplored.   We have developed an explainable, deep learning-based model to predict TTX contamination in the Dutch Zeeland estuary. Inputs for the model were meteorological and hydrological features; output was the presence or absence of TTX contamination.   Results showed that the time of sunrise, time of sunset, global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration contributed most to TTX contamination. Thus, the effective number of sun hours, represented by day length and global radiation, was an important driver for tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks.   To conclude, our explainable deep learning model identified the aforementioned environmental factors (number of sun hours, global radiation, water temperature, and water chloride concentration) to be associated with tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks; making our approach a valuable tool to mitigate marine toxin risks for food industry and competent authorities.",human
"Representation learning on multi-omics data is challenging due to extreme dimensionality, modality heterogeneity, and cohort-specific batch effects. While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with Scrublet, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.",human
"We introduce a novel method for designing attenuation filters in digital audio reverberation systems based on Feedback Delay Networks (FDNs). Our approach uses Second Order Sections (SOS) of Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters arranged as parametric equalizers (PEQ), enabling fine control over frequency-dependent reverberation decay. Unlike traditional graphic equalizer designs, which require numerous filters per delay line, we propose a scalable solution where the number of filters can be adjusted. The frequency, gain, and quality factor (Q) parameters are shared parameters across delay lines and only the gain is adjusted based on delay length. This design not only reduces the number of optimization parameters, but also remains fully differentiable and compatible with gradient-based learning frameworks. Leveraging principles of analog filter design, our method allows for efficient and accurate filter fitting using supervised learning. Our method delivers a flexible and differentiable design, achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational cost.",human
"Crystal structures are characterised by repeating atomic patterns within unit cells across three-dimensional space, posing unique challenges for graph-based representation learning. Current methods often overlook essential periodic boundary conditions and multiscale interactions inherent to crystalline structures. In this paper, we introduce PRISM, a graph neural network framework that explicitly integrates multiscale representations and periodic feature encoding by employing a set of expert modules, each specialised in encoding distinct structural and chemical aspects of periodic systems. Extensive experiments across crystal structure-based benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM improves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, significantly enhancing crystal property prediction.",human
"This paper considers the problem of noise-robust neural operator approximation for the solution map of Calderón's inverse conductivity problem. In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework.",human
"Image manipulation localization (IML) faces a fundamental trade-off between minimizing annotation cost and achieving fine-grained localization accuracy. Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that BoxPromptIML outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models, while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment characteristics.",human
"In this paper, a complexity study is conducted for Versatile Video Codec (VVC) intra partitioning to accelerate the exhaustive search involved in Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) process. To address this problem, two main machine learning techniques are proposed and compared. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approaches are size independent and incorporate the Rate-Distortion (RD) costs of neighboring blocks as input features. The first method is a regression based technique that predicts normalized RD costs of a given Coding Unit (CU). As partitioning possesses the Markov property, the associated decision-making problem can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by Reinforcement Learning (RL). The second approach is a RL agent learned from trajectories of CU decision across two depths with Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Then a pre-determined thresholds are applied for both methods to select a suitable split for the current CU.",human
"Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.",human
"Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities. While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.",human
"Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by utilizing otherwise idle computational resources during memory-to-chip data transfer. Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.",human
"Building self-improving AI systems remains a fundamental challenge in the AI domain. We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.",human

"This article trained a network for perceiving three-dimensional motion information of binocular vision target, which can provide real-time three-dimensional coordinate, velocity, and acceleration, and has a basic spatiotemporal perception capability.

"We seek to clarify the concept of active inference by disentangling it from the Free Energy Principle. We show how the optimizations that need to be carried out in order to implement active inference in discrete state spaces can be formulated as constrained divergence minimization problems which can be solved by standard mean field methods that do not appeal to the idea of expected free energy. When it is used to model perception, the perception/action divergence criterion that we propose coincides with variational free energy. When it is used to model action, it differs from an expected free energy functional by an entropy regularizer.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong generalization across diverse tasks, yet the internal decision-making processes behind their predictions remain opaque. In this work, we study the geometry of hidden representations in LLMs through the lens of \textit{intrinsic dimension} (ID), focusing specifically on decision-making dynamics in a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) setting. We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations. Together, these results suggest LLMs implicitly learn to project linguistic inputs onto structured, low-dimensional manifolds aligned with task-specific decisions, providing new geometric insights into how generalization and reasoning emerge in language models.",human
"Network weights can be reverse-engineered given enough informative samples of a network's input-output function. In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers. With our augmentations we extend the state-of-the-art range of recoverable network sizes. To test their scalability, we show that we can recover networks of up to 100 times more parameters than training data-points.",human
"This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-waveguide pinching-antenna (PA) system (PASS) for multi-user downlink information transmission, motivated by the unknown impact of the integration of emerging PASS and RIS on wireless communications. First, we formulate sum rate (SR) and energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems in a unified framework, subject to constraints on the movable region of PAs, total power budget, and tunable phase of RIS elements. Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability. Moreover, the impact of key parameters on RIS-assisted PASS is illustrated and analyzed.",human
"Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly applied to tasks requiring structured reasoning, tool use, and environmental adaptation, such as data manipulation, multistep planning, and computer-use automation. However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.",human
"Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction algorithms, these methods still encounter two primary limitations: (i) It is challenging to explicitly prove that the prior networks of deep unfolding algorithms satisfy Lipschitz constraints due to their empirically designed nature. (ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/shibaoshun/PromptCT.",human
"Machine unlearning in learned cardinality estimation (CE) systems presents unique challenges due to the complex distributional dependencies in multi-table relational data. Specifically, data deletion, a core component of machine unlearning, faces three critical challenges in learned CE models: attribute-level sensitivity, inter-table propagation and domain disappearance leading to severe overestimation in multi-way joins. We propose Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP), the first unlearning framework specifically designed for multi-table learned CE systems. CEP introduces Distribution Sensitivity Pruning, which constructs semi-join deletion results and computes sensitivity scores to guide parameter pruning, and Domain Pruning, which removes support for value domains entirely eliminated by deletion. We evaluate CEP on state-of-the-art architectures NeuroCard and FACE across IMDB and TPC-H datasets. Results demonstrate CEP consistently achieves the lowest Q-error in multi-table scenarios, particularly under high deletion ratios, often outperforming full retraining. Furthermore, CEP significantly reduces convergence iterations, incurring negligible computational overhead of 0.3%-2.5% of fine-tuning time.",human
"Schema matching is a critical task in data integration, particularly in the medical domain where disparate Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems must be aligned to standard models like OMOP CDM. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in schema matching, they suffer from hallucination and lack of up-to-date domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by providing structured, verifiable knowledge. However, existing KG-augmented LLM approaches often rely on inefficient complex multi-hop queries or storage-intensive vector-based retrieval methods. This paper introduces SMoG (Schema Matching on Graph), a novel framework that leverages iterative execution of simple 1-hop SPARQL queries, inspired by successful strategies in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). SMoG enhances explainability and reliability by generating human-verifiable query paths while significantly reducing storage requirements by directly querying SPARQL endpoints. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that SMoG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and efficiency in KG-augmented schema matching.",human
"Precise access control decisions are crucial to the security of both traditional applications and emerging agent-based systems. Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime. Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users. We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions.   Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users. Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices. Based on our findings, we discuss design and risk considerations for implementing a practical natural-language-based access control system that balances personalization, security, and utility.",human
"Understanding household behaviour is essential for modelling macroeconomic dynamics and designing effective policy. While heterogeneous agent models offer a more realistic alternative to representative agent frameworks, their implementation poses significant computational challenges, particularly in continuous time. The Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett (ABH) framework, recast as a system of partial differential equations, typically relies on grid-based solvers that suffer from the curse of dimensionality, high computational cost, and numerical inaccuracies. This paper introduces the ABH-PINN solver, an approach based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which embeds the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov Forward equations directly into the neural network training objective. By replacing grid-based approximation with mesh-free, differentiable function learning, the ABH-PINN solver benefits from the advantages of PINNs of improved scalability, smoother solutions, and computational efficiency. Preliminary results show that the PINN-based approach is able to obtain economically valid results matching the established finite-difference solvers.",human
"Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have achieved great success in training large-scale models like large language models and diffusion models. However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity   , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties.",human
"Transformer-based language models exhibit complex and distributed behavior, yet their internal computations remain poorly understood. Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals.",human
"Weight Averaging (WA) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing generalization by promoting convergence to a flat loss landscape, which correlates with stronger out-of-distribution performance. However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions. Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show that MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains.",human
"Accurate and interpretable air pollution forecasting is crucial for public health, but most models face a trade-off between performance and interpretability. This study proposes a physics-guided, interpretable-by-design spatiotemporal learning framework. The model decomposes the spatiotemporal behavior of air pollutant concentrations into two transparent, additive modules. The first is a physics-guided transport kernel with directed weights conditioned on wind and geography (advection). The second is an explainable attention mechanism that learns local responses and attributes future concentrations to specific historical lags and exogenous drivers. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Stockholm region, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple forecasting horizons. Our model's integration of high predictive performance and spatiotemporal interpretability provides a more reliable foundation for operational air-quality management in real-world applications.",human
"Purpose: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery relies on endoscopic video as the sole intraoperative visual feedback. The DaVinci Xi system overlays a graphical user interface (UI) that indicates the state of each robotic arm, including the activation of the endoscope arm. Detecting this activation provides valuable metadata such as camera movement information, which can support downstream surgical data science tasks including tool tracking, skill assessment, or camera control automation.   Methods: We developed a lightweight pipeline based on a ResNet18 convolutional neural network to automatically identify the position of the camera tile and its activation state within the DaVinci Xi UI. The model was fine-tuned on manually annotated data from the SurgToolLoc dataset and evaluated across three public datasets comprising over 70,000 frames.   Results: The model achieved F1-scores between 0.993 and 1.000 for the binary detection of active cameras and correctly localized the camera tile in all cases without false multiple-camera detections.   Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables reliable, real-time extraction of camera activation metadata from surgical videos, facilitating automated preprocessing and analysis for diverse downstream applications. All code, trained models, and annotations are publicly available.",human
"Obtaining the precise 3D motion of a table tennis ball from standard monocular videos is a challenging problem, as existing methods trained on synthetic data struggle to generalize to the noisy, imperfect ball and table detections of the real world. This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.",human
"The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is widely used for solving power flow (PF) equations due to its quadratic convergence. However, its performance deteriorates under poor initialization or extreme operating scenarios, e.g., high levels of renewable energy penetration. Traditional NR initialization strategies often fail to address these challenges, resulting in slow convergence or even divergence. We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Specifically, quantum/digital annealers are integrated into the RL environment update to evaluate state transitions using a problem Hamiltonian designed for PF. Results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, a reduction in NR iteration counts, and enhanced robustness under different operating conditions.",human
"Counterfactual explanations enhance the actionable interpretability of machine learning models by identifying the minimal changes required to achieve a desired outcome of the model. However, existing methods often ignore the complex dependencies in real-world datasets, leading to unrealistic or impractical modifications. Motivated by cybersecurity applications in the email marketing domain, we propose a method for generating Diverse, Actionable, and kNowledge-Constrained Explanations (DANCE), which incorporates feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and real-world feasibility of counterfactuals. Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms. The work is developed based on a real-life case study with Freshmail, the largest email marketing company in Poland and supported by a joint R&D project Sendguard. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation using 140 public datasets, which highlights its ability to generate meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals that outperform other existing approaches based on widely used metrics. The source code for reproduction of the results can be found in a GitHub repository we provide.",human
"Generalizability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents (ability to perform on environments different from the ones they have been trained on) is a key problem as agents have the tendency to overfit to their training environments. In order to address this problem and offer a solution to increase the generalizability of RL agents, we introduce a new methodology to predict the generalizability score of RL agents based on the internal weights of the agent's neural networks. Using this prediction capability, we propose some changes in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) loss function to boost the generalization score of the agents trained with this upgraded version. Experimental results demonstrate that our improved PPO algorithm yields agents with stronger generalizability compared to the original version.",human
"The prevalence of misinformation on social media threatens public trust, demanding automated fact-checking systems that provide accurate verdicts with interpretable explanations. However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.",human
"Semi-supervised multi-label learning (SSMLL) aims to address the challenge of limited labeled data in multi-label learning (MLL) by leveraging unlabeled data to improve the model's performance. While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets verify that our method achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.27%.",human
"Duo-Tok is a source-aware dual-codebook tokenizer for vocal-accompaniment music that targets the growing tension between reconstruction quality and language-model (LM) learnability in modern lyrics-to-song systems. Existing codecs either prioritize high-fidelity reconstruction with difficult-to-model acoustic tokens or compress aggressively into semantic tokens that are LM-friendly but lossy, and they rarely make the tokenizer itself aware of dual-track structure. Duo-Tok follows a four-stage, SSL-centered pipeline: we first pretrain a BEST-RQ-style encoder on large-scale audio, then stabilize and factorize the representation with Gaussian replacement noise and multi-task supervision, before freezing the encoder to learn SimVQ-based dual codebooks with hard routing for vocals and accompaniment, and finally training latent diffusion decoders on top of the discrete tokens. Duo-Tok at 0.75 kbps shifts the empirical reconstruction-generation Pareto frontier, achieving the best music-tagging AP and the lowest vocabulary-normalized LM perplexity among compared codecs while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to state-of-the-art music tokenizers.",human
"In critical web applications such as e-commerce and recommendation systems, multimodal graphs integrating rich visual and textual attributes are increasingly central, yet their large scale introduces substantial computational burdens for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search. This research provides a scalable methodology for multimodal graph-based learning in resource-constrained environments.",human
"Satellite constellations in low-Earth orbit are now widespread, enabling positioning, Earth imaging, and communications. In this paper we address the solution of learning problems using these satellite constellations. In particular, we focus on a federated approach, where satellites collect and locally process data, with the ground station aggregating local models. We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression). We then propose an error feedback mechanism that enhances accuracy, which yields, as a byproduct, an algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme that can be more broadly applied. We analyze the convergence of the resulting algorithm, and compare it with the state of the art through simulations in a realistic space scenario, showcasing superior performance.",human
"Existing navigation benchmarks focus on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability -- critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots. We introduce \emph{CostNav}, a \textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\% SLA compliance but is \emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms.",human
"Generative models have excelled in RGB synthesis, but real-world applications require RGBA manipulation. This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion. Our work proves that a unified, multi-task model can learn a superior shared representation for RGBA, paving the way for more powerful, layer-aware generative systems.",human
"This report presents the solution and results of our team MSRA\_SC in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC 2025). We propose a simple yet effective framework that unifies improvements across both GPU Track and API Track. Our method centers on two key components. First, Context Engineering applies dynamic tool pruning and persona clipping for input compression, combined with post-processing techniques such as parameter normalization and function merging. Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance. In the final evaluation, our team ranks 1st in Task 2 API, 2nd in Task 1 API, and 3rd in both Task 3 API and GPU track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve remarkable capabilities but can inadvertently memorize privacy-sensitive information. Although existing unlearning methods can remove such knowledge, they fail to achieve benign forgetting because they often degrade the model's general image understanding performance. To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding. Extensive experiments show that, unlike prior methods, SMFA achieves precise and controllable unlearning while maintaining the model's foundational image understanding.",human
"Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success across language, vision, and multimodal tasks, and there is growing demand for them to address in-context compositional learning tasks. In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets. For certain compositional generalization tasks, our method maintains performance even when standard Transformers fail, owing to its ability to learn and apply compositional rules.",human
"The increasing availability of data and advancements in computational intelligence have accelerated the adoption of data-driven methods (DDMs) in product development. However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models. This review is a first step toward design-stage guidelines; a follow-up synthesis should map computer science algorithms to engineering design problems and activities.",human
"Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ylincen/causal-subgroup.",human
"Kyrgyz remains a low-resource language with limited foundational NLP tools. To address this gap, we introduce KyrgyzBERT, the first publicly available monolingual BERT-based language model for Kyrgyz. The model has 35.9M parameters and uses a custom tokenizer designed for the language's morphological structure. To evaluate performance, we create kyrgyz-sst2, a sentiment analysis benchmark built by translating the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and manually annotating the full test set. KyrgyzBERT fine-tuned on this dataset achieves an F1-score of 0.8280, competitive with a fine-tuned mBERT model five times larger.

"Scalable assessments of mental illness, the leading driver of disability worldwide, remain a critical roadblock toward accessible and equitable care. Here, we show that human-computer interactions encode multiple dimensions of self-reported mental health and their changes over time.   We introduce MAILA, a MAchine-learning framework for Inferring Latent mental states from digital Activity. We trained MAILA to predict 1.3 million mental-health self-reports from 20,000 cursor and touchscreen recordings recorded in 9,000 online participants. The dataset includes 2,000 individuals assessed longitudinally, 1,500 diagnosed with depression, and 500 with obsessive-compulsive disorder. MAILA tracks dynamic mental states along three orthogonal dimensions, generalizes across contexts, and achieves near-ceiling accuracy when predicting group-level mental health. The model translates from general to clinical populations, identifies individuals living with mental illness, and captures signatures of psychological function that are not conveyed by language.   Our results demonstrate how everyday human-computer interactions can power passive, reliable, dynamic, and maximally scalable mental health assessments. The ability to decode mental states at zero marginal cost sets new benchmarks for precision medicine and public health, while raising important questions about privacy, agency, and autonomy online.",human
"The rapid increase in LLM model sizes and the growing demand for long-context inference have made memory a critical bottleneck in GPU-accelerated serving systems. Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.",human
"Neural networks struggle on small tabular datasets, where tree-based models remain dominant. We introduce Adaptive Contrastive Approach (AdaCap), a training scheme that combines a permutation-based contrastive loss with a Tikhonov-based closed-form output mapping. Across 85 real-world regression datasets and multiple architectures, AdaCap yields consistent and statistically significant improvements in the small-sample regime, particularly for residual models. A meta-predictor trained on dataset characteristics (size, skewness, noise) accurately anticipates when AdaCap is beneficial. These results show that AdaCap acts as a targeted regularization mechanism, strengthening neural networks precisely where they are most fragile. All results and code are publicly available at https://github.com/BrunoBelucci/adacap.",human
"Recent works have explored the use of momentum in local methods to enhance distributed SGD. This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity. Despite recent progress in this direction, it is still unclear if momentum can guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity in decentralized scenarios, where only some workers participate at each round. In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $Θ\left(1/t\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound. Numerical results corroborate the theory, and deep learning experiments confirm its relevance for realistic settings.",human
"Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling a diverse range of data analytics and knowledge discovery tasks across scientific fields. Inspired by the success of FMs, particularly large language models, researchers have recently begun to explore spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) to improve adaptability and generalization across a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal (ST) tasks. Despite rapid progress, a systematic investigation of trajectory foundation models (TFMs), a crucial subclass of STFMs, is largely lacking. This tutorial addresses this gap by offering a comprehensive overview of recent advances in TFMs, including a taxonomy of existing methodologies and a critical analysis of their strengths and limitations. In addition, the tutorial highlights open challenges and outlines promising research directions to advance spatio-temporal general intelligence through the development of robust, responsible, and transferable TFMs.",human
"Large multi-modal models (LMMs) show increasing performance in realistic visual tasks for images and, more recently, for videos. For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.",human
"Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in natural language processing, yet it remains particularly challenging for discontinuous entities. The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.",human
"This paper presents a novel approach to neural network compression that addresses redundancy at both the filter and architectural levels through a unified framework grounded in information flow analysis. Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers. The results demonstrate how flow divergence serves as an effective guiding principle for both filter-level and layer-level optimization, offering practical benefits for deployment in resource-constrained environments.",human
"A wiring diagram is a labeled directed graph that represents an abstract concept such as a temporal process. In this article, we introduce the notion of a quasi-skeleton wiring diagram graph, and prove that quasi-skeleton wiring diagram graphs correspond to Hasse diagrams. Using this result, we designed algorithms that extract wiring diagrams from sequential data. We used our algorithms in analyzing the behavior of an autonomous agent playing a computer game, and the algorithms correctly identified the winning strategies. We compared the performance of our main algorithm with two other algorithms based on standard clustering techniques (DBSCAN and agglomerative hierarchical), including when some of the data was perturbed. Overall, this article brings together techniques in category theory, graph theory, clustering, reinforcement learning, and data engineering.",human
"Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation. This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.",human
"Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical mistakes in text. While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97). These findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt-driven NLP techniques and underscore the potential of large-scale LLMs to bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC.",human
"Lung cancer risk estimation is gaining increasing importance as more countries introduce population-wide screening programs using low-dose CT (LDCT). As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets. Existing approaches either over-rely on pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability, or analyze the lung in fragments, weakening performance. We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation. The framework offers a simple, data-efficient, and fully open-source solution that provides an extensible foundation for future research in longitudinal and multimodal lung cancer risk prediction.",human

"Climate science demands automated workflows to transform comprehensive questions into data-driven statements across massive, heterogeneous datasets. However, generic LLM agents and static scripting pipelines lack climate-specific context and flexibility, thus, perform poorly in practice. We present ClimateAgent, an autonomous multi-agent framework that orchestrates end-to-end climate data analytic workflows. ClimateAgent decomposes user questions into executable sub-tasks coordinated by an Orchestrate-Agent and a Plan-Agent; acquires data via specialized Data-Agents that dynamically introspect APIs to synthesize robust download scripts; and completes analysis and reporting with a Coding-Agent that generates Python code, visualizations, and a final report with a built-in self-correction loop. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce Climate-Agent-Bench-85, a benchmark of 85 real-world tasks spanning atmospheric rivers, drought, extreme precipitation, heat waves, sea surface temperature, and tropical cyclones. On Climate-Agent-Bench-85, ClimateAgent achieves 100% task completion and a report quality score of 8.32, outperforming GitHub-Copilot (6.27) and a GPT-5 baseline (3.26).

"This study introduces EM2LDL, a novel multilingual speech corpus designed to advance mixed emotion recognition through label distribution learning. Addressing the limitations of predominantly monolingual and single-label emotion corpora \textcolor{black}{that restrict linguistic diversity, are unable to model mixed emotions, and lack ecological validity}, EM2LDL comprises expressive utterances in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, capturing the intra-utterance code-switching prevalent in multilingual regions like Hong Kong and Macao.

"This study investigates the application of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting of Bitcoin realized volatility. Utilizing a comprehensive set of 69 predictors -- encompassing market, behavioral, and macroeconomic indicators -- we evaluate the performance of LGBM-based models and compare them with both econometric and machine learning baselines. For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization. The results demonstrate that LGBM models effectively capture the nonlinear and high-variance characteristics of cryptocurrency markets while providing interpretable insights into the underlying volatility dynamics.",human
"Prior work has shown that fine-tuning models on a narrow domain with misaligned data can lead to broad misalignment - a phenomenon termed ""emergent misalignment"" (Betley et al. 2025). While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.   We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.   We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse. These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems.",human
"The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.",human
"Developing high-performance GPU kernels is critical for AI and scientific computing, but remains challenging due to its reliance on expert crafting and poor portability. While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.",human
"Advances in artificial intelligence now make it possible to simulate the dead through chatbots, voice clones, and video avatars trained on a person's digital traces. These ""digital ghosts"" are moving from fiction to commercial reality, reshaping how people mourn and remember. This paper offers a conceptual and ethical analysis of AI-mediated digital afterlives. We define what counts as a digital ghost, trace their rise across personal, commercial, and institutional contexts, and identify core ethical tensions around grief and well-being, truthfulness and deception, consent and posthumous privacy, dignity and misrepresentation, and the commercialization of mourning. To analyze these challenges, we propose a nine-dimensional taxonomy of digital afterlife technologies and, building on it, outline the features of an ethically acceptable digital ghost: premortem intent, mutual consent, transparent and limited data use, clear disclosure, restricted purposes and access, family or estate stewardship, and minimal behavioral agency. We argue for targeted regulation and professional guidelines to ensure that digital ghosts can aid remembrance without slipping into forms of deception.",human
"Repairing RTL bugs is crucial for hardware design and verification. Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability.",human
"In recent years, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant attention due to its ability to identify anomalous images using only normal images during training. Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.",human
"With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their performance on multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks has improved significantly. However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks. Our experiments showcase that BiasPrompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex and challenging questions, particularly in settings where existing methods underperform.",human
"The current remote sensing image analysis task is increasingly evolving from traditional object recognition to complex intelligence reasoning, which places higher requirements on the model's reasoning ability and the flexibility of tool invocation. To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.",human
"Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks.",human
"Computer Use Agents (CUAs) are designed to autonomously operate digital interfaces, yet they often fail to reliably determine whether a given task has been completed. We present an autonomous evaluation and feedback framework that uses vision-language models to assess task completion directly from screenshots and task descriptions. Our dataset covers 42 built-in macOS applications and 1,260 human-labeled tasks across a wide range of scenarios. Our framework achieves up to 73 percent accuracy in task success detection and yields an average relative improvement of 27 percent in overall task success when evaluator feedback is applied. These results show that vision-based evaluation can serve as an effective feedback mechanism that improves the reliability and self-correction of autonomous computer-use agents.",human
"We address the challenge of efficient exploration in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where the system dynamics are unknown and the RL agent must learn directly from online interactions. We propose Scalable and Optimistic MBRL (SOMBRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. SOMBRL learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and the agent's epistemic uncertainty. SOMBRL is compatible with any policy optimizers or planners, and under common regularity assumptions on the system, we show that SOMBRL has sublinear regret for nonlinear dynamics in the (i) finite-horizon, (ii) discounted infinite-horizon, and (iii) non-episodic settings. Additionally, SOMBRL offers a flexible and scalable solution for principled exploration. We evaluate SOMBRL on state-based and visual-control environments, where it displays strong performance across all tasks and baselines. We also evaluate SOMBRL on a dynamic RC car hardware and show SOMBRL outperforms the state-of-the-art, illustrating the benefits of principled exploration for MBRL.",human
"We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.",human
"Personalized Visual Language Models (VLMs) are gaining increasing attention for their formidable ability in user-specific concepts aligned interactions (e.g., identifying a user's bike). Existing methods typically require the learning of separate embeddings for each new concept, which fails to support real-time adaptation during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in large-scale scenarios, where efficient retrieval of concept embeddings is not achievable. To alleviate this gap, we propose Online-PVLM, a framework for online concept learning by leveraging hyperbolic representations. Our approach makes a train-free paradigm for concept embeddings generation at test time, making the use of personalized VLMs both scalable and efficient. In addition, we develop OP-Eval, a comprehensive and large-scale benchmark comprising 1,292 concepts and over 30K high-quality instances with diverse question types, designed to rigorously assess online concept learning in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed framework. Our source code and dataset will be made available.",human
"LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.",human
"The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in multivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future context to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks.",human
"In recent years, point cloud generation has gained significant attention in 3D generative modeling. Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods. In particular, MFM-point demonstrates strong results in multi-category and high-resolution generation tasks.",human
"Hard attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are known to be Turing-complete. However, it is an open problem whether softmax attention Chain-of-Thought (CoT) transformers are Turing-complete. In this paper, we prove a stronger result that length-generalizable softmax CoT transformers are Turing-complete. More precisely, our Turing-completeness proof goes via the CoT extension of the Counting RASP (C-RASP), which correspond to softmax CoT transformers that admit length generalization. We prove Turing-completeness for CoT C-RASP with causal masking over a unary alphabet (more generally, for letter-bounded languages). While we show this is not Turing-complete for arbitrary languages, we prove that its extension with relative positional encoding is Turing-complete for arbitrary languages. We empirically validate our theory by training transformers for languages requiring complex (non-linear) arithmetic reasoning.",human
"Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs) are an expressive data model for representing the complex interconnections among entities that associate attributes from multiple data modalities (text, images, etc.). Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance.   Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels.",human
"Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.",human
"Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong understanding of driving scenes, drawing interest in their application to autonomous driving. However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improves their reasoning ability, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset in developing safer and more reasoning-capable driving agents.",human
"The Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis (CBH) posits that larger brains evolved to enhance survival in changing conditions. However, larger brains also carry higher energy demands, imposing additional metabolic burdens. Alongside brain size, brain organization plays a key role in cognitive ability and, with suitable architectures, may help mitigate energy challenges. This study evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) used by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to investigate how environmental variability and energy costs influence the evolution of neural complexity, defined in terms of ANN size and structure. Results indicate that under energy constraints, increasing seasonality led to smaller ANNs. This challenges CBH and supports the Expensive Brain Hypothesis (EBH), as highly seasonal environments reduced net energy intake and thereby constrained brain size. ANN structural complexity primarily emerged as a byproduct of size, where energy costs promoted the evolution of more efficient networks. These results highlight the role of energy constraints in shaping neural complexity, offering in silico support for biological theory and energy-efficient robotic design.",human
"Radio maps (RMs) serve as environment-aware electromagnetic (EM) representations that connect scenario geometry and material properties to the spatial distribution of signal strength, enabling localization without costly in-situ measurements. However, constructing high-fidelity indoor RMs remains challenging due to the prohibitive latency of EM solvers and the limitations of learning-based methods, which often rely on sparse measurements or assumptions of homogeneous material, which are misaligned with the heterogeneous and multipath-rich nature of indoor environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives. This design enables accurate modeling of nonstationary field discontinuities and efficient construction of physically consistent RMs. Experiments demonstrate that iRadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor RM construction and received signal strength based indoor localization, which offers effective generalization across layouts and material configurations. Code is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/iRadioDiff.",human
"Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for autonomous vehicles to improve pedestrian safety and reduce traffic accidents. However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the network architecture and contribution of different input context. Our code is open-source: https://github.com/ZhongHang0307/Multi-Context-Fusion-Transformer.",human
"Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban environments. Ideal prediction provides AVs with critical environmental cues, thereby reducing the risk of pedestrian-related collisions. However, the prediction task is challenging due to the diverse nature of pedestrian behavior and its dependence on multiple contextual factors. This paper proposes a multimodal fusion network that leverages seven modality features from both visual and motion branches, aiming to effectively extract and integrate complementary cues across different modalities. Specifically, motion and visual features are extracted from the raw inputs using multiple Transformer-based extraction modules. Depth-guided attention module leverages depth information to guide attention towards salient regions in another modality through comprehensive spatial feature interactions. To account for the varying importance of different modalities and frames, modality attention and temporal attention are designed to selectively emphasize informative modalities and effectively capture temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on the JAAD dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, achieving superior performance compared to the baseline methods.",human
"Automatic Pitch Correction (APC) enhances vocal recordings by aligning pitch deviations with the intended musical notes. However, existing APC systems either rely on reference pitches, which limits their practical applicability, or employ simple pitch estimation algorithms that often fail to preserve expressiveness and naturalness. We propose BERT-APC, a novel reference-free APC framework that corrects pitch errors while maintaining the natural expressiveness of vocal performances. In BERT-APC, a novel stationary pitch predictor first estimates the perceived pitch of each note from the detuned singing voice. A context-aware note pitch predictor estimates the intended pitch sequence by leveraging a music language model repurposed to incorporate musical context. Finally, a note-level correction algorithm fixes pitch errors while preserving intentional pitch deviations for emotional expression. In addition, we introduce a learnable data augmentation strategy that improves the robustness of the music language model by simulating realistic detuning patterns. Compared to two recent singing voice transcription models, BERT-APC demonstrated superior performance in note pitch prediction, outperforming the second-best model, ROSVOT, by 10.49%p on highly detuned samples in terms of the raw pitch accuracy. In the MOS test, BERT-APC achieved the highest score of $4.32 \pm 0.15$, which is significantly higher than those of the widely-used commercial APC tools, AutoTune ($3.22 \pm 0.18$) and Melodyne ($3.08 \pm 0.18$), while maintaining a comparable ability to preserve expressive nuances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first APC model that leverages a music language model to achieve reference-free pitch correction with symbolic musical context. The corrected audio samples of BERT-APC are available online.",human
"This work investigates the zero-shot forecasting capability of time-series foundation models for Leaf Area Index (LAI) forecasting in agricultural monitoring. Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.",human
"Conventional adversarial attacks focus on manipulating a single decision of neural networks. However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.   This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying ""non-motorized lane"" signs as ""motorized lane"" and ""pedestrian"" as ""plastic bag"".   To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.",human
"Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous ""split-then-balance"" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard (""Social Media Screener"") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.",human

"REWA introduces a general theory of similarity based on witness-overlap structures. We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $Δ(u, v) = |W(u) \cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\log(|V|/δ))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering. This manuscript presents the axioms, the main reducibility theorem, complete proofs with explicit constants, and a detailed discussion of compositional design, limitations, and future extensions including multi-bit encodings, weighted witnesses, and non-set representations.",human
"Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a ""reversal curse,"" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.",human
"We propose RankOOD, a rank-based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection approach based on training a model with the Placket-Luce loss, which is now extensively used for preference alignment tasks in foundational models. Our approach is based on the insight that with a deep learning model trained using the Cross Entropy Loss, in-distribution (ID) class prediction induces a ranking pattern for each ID class prediction. The RankOOD framework formalizes the insight by first extracting a rank list for each class using an initial classifier and then uses another round of training with the Plackett-Luce loss, where the class rank, a fixed permutation for each class, is the predicted variable. An OOD example may get assigned with high probability to an ID example, but the probability of it respecting the ranking classification is likely to be small. RankOOD, achieves SOTA performance on the near-ODD TinyImageNet evaluation benchmark, reducing FPR95 by 4.3%.",human
"Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.",human
"Decoder-only rerankers are central to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines. Our results confirm that R2R is a model-agnostic and modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness.",human
"Sparsity is essential for deploying large models on resource constrained edge platforms. However, optimizing sparsity patterns for individual tasks in isolation ignores the significant I/O overhead incurred during frequent task switching. We introduce an on-demand multi-task sparsity framework specifically designed to minimize switching costs by maximizing parameter reuse. Unlike monolithic approaches, we decompose weights into reusable block-granular units and align sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap. By dynamically loading only the small differential set of blocks required for the next task, our method effectively mitigates the cold-start latency inherent in traditional monolithic approaches.Experiments on a real-world autonomous driving platform demonstrate that our framework achieves superior switching efficiency, accelerating task switching by over 6.6X on average compared to existing sparsity methods.",human
"Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as go-to models for learning on graph-structured data in the past decade. Despite their effectiveness, most of such models still incur severe issues such as over-smoothing and -correlation, due to their underlying objective of minimizing the Dirichlet energy and the derived neighborhood aggregation operations. In this paper, we propose the DDSM, a new MPNN model built on an optimization framework that includes the stress majorization and orthogonal regularization for overcoming the above issues. Further, we introduce the diffusion distances for nodes into the framework to guide the new message passing operations and develop efficient algorithms for distance approximations, both backed by rigorous theoretical analyses. Our comprehensive experiments showcase that DDSM consistently and considerably outperforms 15 strong baselines on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.",human
"Continuous emotional image generation (C-EICG) is emerging rapidly due to its ability to produce images aligned with both user descriptions and continuous emotional values. However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback$^2$) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset. The code and dataset will be released soon.",human
"Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.",human
"The emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs) has offered a powerful tool for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Subsequent studies have achieved further improvements through refining the message passing schemes in GNN models or exploiting various data augmentation techniques to mitigate limited supervision. In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods.   Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity. Our extensive experiments showcase that the proposed NCGC framework consistently and considerably outperforms popular GNN models and recent baselines for semi-supervised node classification on seven real graphs, when working with various classic GNN backbones.",human
"Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.",human
"Recent advancements in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG), which enhance multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with external knowledge, have demonstrated that the collective intelligence of multiple agents can significantly outperform a single model through effective communication. Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.",human
"Asynchronous federated learning (FL) has recently gained attention for its enhanced efficiency and scalability, enabling local clients to send model updates to the server at their own pace without waiting for slower participants. However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.",human
"Despite decades of progress, a truly input-size agnostic visual encoder-a fundamental characteristic of human vision-has remained elusive. We address this limitation by proposing \textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a novel diffusion-inspired loss function that provides dense, step-wise supervision, training the model to build confidence as it gathers more visual evidence. We demonstrate that MambaEye exhibits robust performance across a wide range of image resolutions, especially at higher resolutions such as $1536^2$ on the ImageNet-1K classification task. This feat is achieved while maintaining linear time and memory complexity relative to the number of patches.",human
"Federated learning (FL) has been extensively studied as a privacy-preserving training paradigm. Recently, federated block coordinate descent scheme has become a popular option in training large-scale models, as it allows clients to train only a subset of the model locally instead of the entire model. However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning LLMs on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves communication efficiency.",human
"Computer Using Agents (CUAs) are increasingly equipped with external tools, enabling them to perform complex and realistic tasks. For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs. The source is available at https://github.com/microsoft/appselectbench.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs), though shown to be effective in many applications, can vary significantly in their response quality. In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups.",human
"Forward Collision Warning systems are crucial for vehicle safety and autonomous driving, yet current methods often fail to balance precise multi-agent interaction modeling with real-time decision adaptability, evidenced by the high computational cost for edge deployment and the unreliability stemming from simplified interaction models.To overcome these dual challenges-computational complexity and modeling insufficiency-along with the high false alarm rates of traditional static-threshold warnings, this paper introduces an integrated FCW framework that pairs a Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with a Dynamic Risk Threshold Adjustment algorithm. HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.",human
"PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.",human
"Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel ""free-lunch"" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.",human
"It is widely recognized that reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models often leads to \textit{diversity collapse}, where outputs lack variety. Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics. Our theory precisely characterizes when existing heuristics help and why they fail, while showing that differential smoothing is universally superior. Extensive experiments with models from 1B to 7B parameters, across domains including CountDown and real-world mathematical reasoning, demonstrate consistent gains. Differential smoothing improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k, with up to 6.7\% improvements on AIME24 dataset.",human
"Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) leverages transient-state signal dynamics generated by the tunable acquisition parameters, making the design of an optimal, robust sequence a complex, high-dimensional sequential decision problem, such as optimizing one of the key parameters, flip angle. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to automate parameter selection, to optimize pulse sequences that maximize the distinguishability of fingerprints across the parameter space. In this work, we introduce an RL framework for optimizing the flip-angle schedule in MRF and demonstrate a learned schedule exhibiting non-periodic patterns that enhances fingerprint separability. Additionally, an interesting observation is that the RL-optimized schedule may enable a reduction in the number of repetition time, potentially accelerate MRF acquisitions.",human
"Universal online learning aims to achieve optimal regret guarantees without requiring prior knowledge of the curvature of online functions. Existing methods have established minimax-optimal regret bounds for universal online learning, where a single algorithm can simultaneously attain $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for convex functions, $\mathcal{O}(d \log T)$ for exp-concave functions, and $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ for strongly convex functions, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $d$ is the dimension of the feasible domain. However, these methods still lack problem-dependent adaptivity. In particular, no universal method provides regret bounds that scale with the gradient variation $V_T$, a key quantity that plays a crucial role in applications such as stochastic optimization and fast-rate convergence in games. In this work, we introduce UniGrad, a novel approach that achieves both universality and adaptivity, with two distinct realizations: UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman. Both methods achieve universal regret guarantees that adapt to gradient variation, simultaneously attaining $\mathcal{O}(\log V_T)$ regret for strongly convex functions and $\mathcal{O}(d \log V_T)$ regret for exp-concave functions. For convex functions, the regret bounds differ: UniGrad.Correct achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_T \log V_T})$ bound while preserving the RVU property that is crucial for fast convergence in online games, whereas UniGrad.Bregman achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_T})$ regret bound through a novel design. Both methods employ a meta algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ base learners, which naturally requires $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ gradient queries per round. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce UniGrad++, which retains the regret while reducing the gradient query to just $1$ per round via surrogate optimization. We further provide various implications.",human
"The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has increased the demand for domain-specialized variants in areas such as law, healthcare, and finance. However, their large size remains a barrier to deployment in resource-constrained environments, and existing compression methods either generalize poorly across domains or incur high overhead. In this work, we propose \textbf{EfficientXpert}, a lightweight domain-pruning framework that combines a propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) with an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon). Integrated into the LoRA fine-tuning process, EfficientXpert enables a one-step transformation of general pretrained models into sparse, domain-adapted experts. Across health and legal tasks, it retains up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis reveals substantial domain-dependent structural shifts that degrade the effectiveness of general pruning masks, underscoring the need for adaptive, domain-aware pruning strategies tailored to each domain.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly integrated into decision-support tools, automation workflows, and AI-enabled software systems. However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems. By framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem rather than a purely model-centric one, this work provides an analytical foundation for future research on evaluation methodology, AI system robustness, and dependable LLM deployment.",human
"Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) has been proposed to enrich user-item interactions by incorporating information from various domains. Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross-domain preferences within the mixed interaction sequence, resulting in poor next-item prediction performance for specific domains. With world knowledge and powerful reasoning ability, Large Language Models (LLMs) partially alleviate the above issues by performing as a generator and an encoder. However, current LLMs-enhanced CDSR methods are still under exploration, which fail to recognize the irrelevant noise and rough profiling problems. Thus, to make peace with the aforementioned challenges, we proposed an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training ({LLM-EDT}). To address the imbalance issue while introducing less irrelevant noise, we first propose the transferable item augmenter to adaptively generate possible cross-domain behaviors for users. Then, to alleviate the transition issue, we introduce a dual-phase training strategy to empower the domain-specific thread with a domain-shared background. As for the rough profiling problem, we devise a domain-aware profiling module to summarize the user's preference in each domain and adaptively aggregate them to generate comprehensive user profiles. The experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-EDT. To ease reproducibility, we have released the detailed code online at {https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-EDT-583F}.",human
"Recent advances in machine learning and big data analytics have intensified the demand for high-quality cross-domain datasets and accelerated the growth of data trading across organizations. As data become increasingly recognized as an economic asset, data marketplaces have emerged as a key infrastructure for data-driven innovation. However, unlike mature product or service markets, data-trading environments remain nascent and suffer from pronounced information asymmetry. Buyers cannot verify the content or quality before purchasing data, making trust and quality assurance central challenges. To address these issues, this study develops a multi-agent data-market simulator that models participant behavior and evaluates the institutional mechanisms for trust formation. Focusing on the manufacturing sector, where initiatives such as GAIA-X and Catena-X are advancing, the simulator integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive agent behavior and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate utility functions from empirical behavioral data. Using the simulator, we examine the market-level effects of five representative reputation systems-Time-decay, Bayesian-beta, PageRank, PowerTrust, and PeerTrust-and found that PeerTrust achieved the strongest alignment between data price and quality, while preventing monopolistic dominance. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid reputation mechanism that integrates the strengths of existing systems to achieve improved price-quality consistency and overall market stability. This study extends simulation-based data-market analysis by incorporating trust and reputation as endogenous mechanisms and offering methodological and institutional insights into the design of reliable and efficient data ecosystems.",human
"Evaluating the open-form textual responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) typically requires measuring the semantic similarity of the response to a (human generated) reference. However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

"Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown significant advancements in video understanding, especially in feature alignment, event reasoning, and instruction-following tasks. However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels. Dataset and code will be further released.",human
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, have led to widespread adoption across various applications. Yet, a fundamental challenge persists: how can we verify the correctness of AI model inference when model owners cannot (or will not) reveal their parameters? These parameters represent enormous training costs and valuable intellectual property, making transparent verification difficult. In this paper, we introduce a zero-knowledge framework capable of verifying deep learning inference without exposing model internal parameters. Built on recursively composed zero-knowledge proofs and requiring no trusted setup, our framework supports both linear and nonlinear neural network layers, including matrix multiplication, normalization, softmax, and SiLU. Leveraging the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, we obtain a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) with constant-size proofs. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we translate the DeepSeek model into a fully SNARK-verifiable version named ZK-DeepSeek and show experimentally that our framework delivers both efficiency and flexibility in real-world AI verification workloads.",human
"Vision-language agents have achieved remarkable progress in a variety of multimodal reasoning tasks; however, their learning remains constrained by the limitations of human-annotated supervision. Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

"Tree search-based methods have made significant progress in enhancing the code generation capabilities of large language models. However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.",human
"Ride-hailing platforms are characterized by high-frequency, behavior-driven environments. Although survival analysis has been applied to recurrent events in other domains, its use in modeling ride-hailing driver behavior remains largely unexplored. This study formulates idle behavior as a recurrent survival process using large-scale platform data and proposes a Transformer-based framework that captures long-term temporal dependencies with causal masking and incorporates driver-specific embeddings to model latent heterogeneity. Results on Toronto ride-hailing data demonstrate that the proposed Frailty-Aware Cox Transformer (FACT) achieves the highest time-dependent C-indices and lowest Brier Scores, outperforming classical and deep learning survival models. This approach enables more accurate risk estimation, supports platform retention strategies, and provides policy-relevant insights.",human
"Knowledge distillation (KD) has proven highly effective for compressing large models and enhancing the performance of smaller ones. However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/Johumliu/FD-CMKD.",human
"Despite advancements in language-controlled reinforcement learning (LC-RL) for basic domains and straightforward commands (e.g., object manipulation and navigation), effectively extending LC-RL to comprehend and execute high-level or abstract instructions in complex, multi-agent environments, such as football games, remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we introduce Language-Controlled Diverse Style Policies (LCDSP), a novel LC-RL paradigm specifically designed for complex scenarios. LCDSP comprises two key components: a Diverse Style Training (DST) method and a Style Interpreter (SI). The DST method efficiently trains a single policy capable of exhibiting a wide range of diverse behaviors by modulating agent actions through style parameters (SP). The SI is designed to accurately and rapidly translate high-level language instructions into these corresponding SP. Through extensive experiments in a complex 5v5 football environment, we demonstrate that LCDSP effectively comprehends abstract tactical instructions and accurately executes the desired diverse behavioral styles, showcasing its potential for complex, real-world applications.",human
"We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.",human
"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models inherit strong priors from pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but naive fine-tuning often disrupts these representations and harms generalization. Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer.",human
"Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.",human
"Version control relies on commit messages to convey the rationale for code changes, but these messages are often low quality and, more critically, inconsistent with their diffs-known as message-code inconsistency (MCI). MCIs mislead reviewers, hinder maintenance, contaminate research datasets, and may obscure security patches. Yet, no dedicated benchmark exists to evaluate models for MCI detection. We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level ""purpose"" inconsistencies. CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL provides a rigorous foundation for measuring, comparing, and advancing MCI detection, highlighting the need for richer context and balanced data to capture high-level semantic gaps.",human
"As AI agents become integral to enterprise workflows, their reliance on shared tool libraries and pre-trained components creates significant supply chain vulnerabilities. While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing. Our analysis reveals that this gap stems from model-specific behavioral signatures, particularly in temporal features (coefficient of variation > 0.8), while structural features remain stable across architectures. We show that model-aware detection incorporating model identity as an additional feature achieves 90.6% accuracy universally across all evaluated models. We release our multi-LLM trace dataset and detection framework to enable reproducible research.",human
"Self-assessment is a key aspect of reliable intelligence, yet evaluations of large language models (LLMs) focus mainly on task accuracy. We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations. Psychometric prompting provides structured insight into LLM communication behavior but not calibrated performance estimates.",human
"In the 6G era, semantic collaboration among multiple embodied intelligent devices (MEIDs) becomes crucial for complex task execution. However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices. Finally, the InDec module enhances decision transparency through Grad-CAM visualization. Simulation results in post-earthquake rescue scenarios demonstrate that CC-EIN achieves 95.4% task completion rate and 95% transmission efficiency while maintaining strong semantic consistency and energy efficiency.",human
"Educational simulations have long been recognized as powerful tools for enhancing learning outcomes, yet their creation has traditionally required substantial resources and technical expertise. This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand. We discuss implementation considerations, present evidence of effectiveness, and outline future directions for AI-powered adaptive learning systems built on the MicroSim foundation.",human
"Objective: Clinical documentation contains factual, diagnostic, and management errors that can compromise patient safety. Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.   Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.   Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.   Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.",human
"Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be an effective way to create more engaging and enjoyable user-AI interactions. While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process. These findings underscore the importance of prompt optimization in shaping personality expression within LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research on adaptive AI interactions.",human
"Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two effective distributed learning paradigms in wireless networks, enabling collaborative model training across mobile devices without sharing raw data. While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence to the target accuracy compared to existing methods.",human
"Reinforcement learning (RL) commonly relies on scalar rewards with limited ability to express temporal, conditional, or safety-critical goals, and can lead to reward hacking. Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $ω$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.   We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $ω$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $ω$-regular objective while also adhering to $ω$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees.",human
"Decision trees remain central for tabular prediction but struggle with (i) capturing spatial dependence and (ii) producing locally stable (robust) explanations. We present SX-GeoTree, a self-explaining geospatial regression tree that integrates three coupled objectives during recursive splitting: impurity reduction (MSE), spatial residual control (global Moran's I), and explanation robustness via modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network formed from (a) geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficient distances (stimulus-response similarity) and (b) SHAP attribution distances (explanatory similarity). We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability. The framework demonstrates how spatial similarity - extended beyond geometric proximity through GWR-derived local relationships - can be embedded in interpretable models, advancing trustworthy geospatial machine learning and offering a transferable template for domain-aware explainability.",human
"We introduce the Cisco Time Series Model, a univariate zero-shot forecaster. This time series foundation model is the result of a general architectural innovation to a time series model enabling it to accept multiresolution input, applied to a popular decoder-only time series model (TimesFM). The resulting multiresolution decoder-only model is trained on over 300B unique data points, with more than half coming from the observability domain. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the resulting model achieves superior performance on observability datasets while retaining very similar performance on a standard general-purpose forecasting benchmark (GIFT-Eval), and suggest that the multiresolution structure enables the model to make more accurate predictions on long context input.",human
"Graph Similarity Computation (GSC) is a fundamental graph related task where Graph Edit Distance (GED) serves as a prevalent metric. GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our comprehensive analyses further validate that the framework effectively learns disentangled and semantically meaningful substructure representations.",human
"Diffusion Transformers dominate video generation, but the quadratic complexity of attention computation introduces substantial latency. Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality. We release Rectified SpaAttn as open-source at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn .",human
"World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.   Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.",human
"Multi-modal analytical processing has the potential to transform applications in e-commerce, healthcare, entertainment, and beyond. However, real-world adoption remains elusive due to the limited ability of traditional relational query operators to capture query semantics. The emergence of foundation models, particularly the large language models (LLMs), opens up new opportunities to develop flexible, semantic-aware data analytics systems that transcend the relational paradigm.   We present Nirvana, a multi-modal data analytics framework that incorporates programmable semantic operators while leveraging both logical and physical query optimization strategies, tailored for LLM-driven semantic query processing. Nirvana addresses two key challenges. First, it features an agentic logical optimizer that uses natural language-specified transformation rules and random-walk-based search to explore vast spaces of semantically equivalent query plans -- far beyond the capabilities of conventional optimizers. Second, it introduces a cost-aware physical optimizer that selects the most effective LLM backend for each operator using a novel improvement-score metric. To further enhance efficiency, Nirvana incorporates computation reuse and evaluation pushdown techniques guided by model capability hypotheses. Experimental evaluations on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that Nirvana is able to reduce end-to-end runtime by 10%--85% and reduces system processing costs by 76% on average, outperforming state-of-the-art systems at both efficiency and scalability.",human
"Most prompt-optimization methods refine a single static template, making them ineffective in complex and dynamic user scenarios. Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.",human
"Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have enabled a new frontier in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs), offering superior performance by activating only a fraction of their total parameters during inference. However, their practical deployment is severely hampered by substantial static memory overhead, as all experts must be loaded into memory. Existing post-training pruning methods, while reducing model size, often derive their pruning criteria from a single, general-purpose corpus. This leads to a critical limitation: a catastrophic performance degradation when the pruned model is applied to other domains, necessitating a costly re-pruning for each new domain. To address this generalization gap, we introduce Mosaic Pruning (MoP). The core idea of MoP is to construct a functionally comprehensive set of experts through a structured ``cluster-then-select"" process. This process leverages a similarity metric that captures expert performance across different task domains to functionally cluster the experts, and subsequently selects the most representative expert from each cluster based on our proposed Activation Variability Score. Unlike methods that optimize for a single corpus, our proposed Mosaic Pruning ensures that the pruned model retains a functionally complementary set of experts, much like the tiles of a mosaic that together form a complete picture of the original model's capabilities, enabling it to handle diverse downstream tasks.Extensive experiments on various MoE models demonstrate the superiority of our approach. MoP significantly outperforms prior work, achieving a 7.24\% gain on general tasks and 8.92\% on specialized tasks like math reasoning and code generation.",human
"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with tasks that require fine-grained image understanding, such as scene-text recognition or document analysis, due to perception limitations and visual fragmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce CropVLM as an external low-cost method for boosting performance, enabling VLMs to dynamically ''zoom in'' on relevant image regions, enhancing their ability to capture fine details. CropVLM is trained using reinforcement learning, without using human-labeled bounding boxes as a supervision signal, and without expensive synthetic evaluations. The model is trained once and can be paired with both open-source and proprietary VLMs to improve their performance. Our approach delivers significant improvements on tasks that require high-resolution image understanding, notably for benchmarks that are out-of-domain for the target VLM, without modifying or fine-tuning the VLM, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.",human
"Sentiment analysis is a helpful task to automatically analyse opinions and emotions on various topics in areas such as AI for Social Good, AI in Education or marketing. While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.",human
"Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences.

"Image diversity remains a fundamental challenge for text-to-image diffusion models. Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.",human
"We present a case study for the calibration of Low-cost air-quality (LCAQ) CO sensors from one of the largest multi-site-multi-season-multi-sensor-multi-pollutant mobile air-quality monitoring network deployments in India. LCAQ sensors have been shown to play a critical role in the establishment of dense, expansive air-quality monitoring networks and combating elevated pollution levels. The calibration of LCAQ sensors against regulatory-grade monitors is an expensive, laborious and time-consuming process, especially when a large number of sensors are to be deployed in a geographically diverse layout. In this work, we present the RESPIRE technique to calibrate LCAQ sensors to detect ambient CO (Carbon Monoxide) levels. RESPIRE offers specific advantages over baseline calibration methods popular in literature, such as improved prediction in cross-site, cross-season, and cross-sensor settings. RESPIRE offers a training algorithm that is provably resistant to outliers and an explainable model with the ability to flag instances of model overfitting. Empirical results are presented based on data collected during an extensive deployment spanning four sites, two seasons and six sensor packages. RESPIRE code is available at https://github.com/purushottamkar/respire.",human
"The challenge of learning with noisy labels is significant in machine learning, as it can severely degrade the performance of prediction models if not addressed properly. This paper introduces a novel framework that conceptualizes noisy label correction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. The proposed approach, Reinforcement Learning for Noisy Label Correction (RLNLC), defines a comprehensive state space representing data and their associated labels, an action space that indicates possible label corrections, and a reward mechanism that evaluates the efficacy of label corrections. RLNLC learns a deep feature representation based policy network to perform label correction through reinforcement learning, utilizing an actor-critic method. The learned policy is subsequently deployed to iteratively correct noisy training labels and facilitate the training of the prediction model. The effectiveness of RLNLC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques for learning with noisy labels.",human
"We investigate complex-valued Variational AutoEncoders (CVAE) for radar Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection in complex radar environments. We proposed several detection metrics: the reconstruction error of CVAE (CVAE-MSE), the latent-based scores (Mahalanobis, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)), and compared their performance against the classical ANMF-Tyler detector (ANMF-FP). The performance of all these detectors is analyzed on synthetic and experimental radar data, showing the advantages and the weaknesses of each detector.",human
"Data attribution seeks to trace model behavior back to the training examples that shaped it, enabling debugging, auditing, and data valuation at scale. Classical influence-function methods offer a principled foundation but remain impractical for modern networks because they require expensive backpropagation or Hessian inversion at inference. We propose a data attribution method that preserves the same first-order counterfactual target while eliminating per-query backward passes. Our approach simulates each training example's parameter influence through short-horizon gradient propagation during training and later reads out attributions for any query using only forward evaluations. This design shifts computation from inference to simulation, reflecting real deployment regimes where a model may serve billions of user queries but originate from a fixed, finite set of data sources (for example, a large language model trained on diverse corpora while compensating a specific publisher such as the New York Times). Empirically, on standard MLP benchmarks, our estimator matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines such as TRAK on standard attribution metrics (LOO and LDS) while offering orders-of-magnitude lower inference cost. By combining influence-function fidelity with first-order scalability, our method provides a theoretical framework for practical, real-time data attribution in large pretrained models.",human
"Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects more than 600 million individuals globally and is associated with significant pain, functional impairment, and disability. While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.",human
"We propose Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM), a generalization of flow matching that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling. TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.",human
"Recent machine learning papers often report 1-2 percentage point improvements from a single run on a benchmark. These gains are highly sensitive to random seeds, data ordering, and implementation details, yet are rarely accompanied by uncertainty estimates or significance tests. It is therefore unclear when a reported +1-2% reflects a real algorithmic advance versus noise.   We revisit this problem under realistic compute budgets, where only a few runs are affordable. We propose a simple, PC-friendly evaluation protocol based on paired multi-seed runs, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals, and a sign-flip permutation test on per-seed deltas. The protocol is intentionally conservative and is meant as a guardrail against over-claiming.   We instantiate it on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10N, and AG News using synthetic no-improvement, small-gain, and medium-gain scenarios. Single runs and unpaired t-tests often suggest significant gains for 0.6-2.0 point improvements, especially on text. With only three seeds, our paired protocol never declares significance in these settings. We argue that such conservative evaluation is a safer default for small gains under tight budgets.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.",human
"The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their growing integration into daily life underscore the importance of evaluating and ensuring their fairness. In this work, we examine fairness within the domain of emotional theory of mind, investigating whether LLMs exhibit gender biases when presented with a description of a person and their environment and asked, ""How does this person feel?"". Furthermore, we propose and evaluate several debiasing strategies, demonstrating that achieving meaningful reductions in bias requires training based interventions rather than relying solely on inference-time prompt-based approaches such as prompt engineering.",human
"We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents by integrating a structured intent ontology with compact language models. Our method leverages retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into both input and output representations. We formalize a new evaluation metric-Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS)-based on hierarchical ontology depth, capturing semantic proximity even when predicted intents differ lexically. Experiments on a subset of ambiguous/demanding dialogues of MultiWOZ 2.3 (with oracle labels from GPT-o3) demonstrate that a 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation approaches GPT-4 accuracy (85% vs 90%) at a tiny fraction of the energy and memory footprint. Qualitative comparisons show that ontology-augmented models produce more grounded, disambiguated multi-intent interpretations. Our results validate symbolic alignment as an effective strategy for enabling accurate and efficient on-device NLU.",human
"While recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong image understanding, their ability to ""think with images"", i.e., to reason through multi-step visual interactions, remains limited. We introduce VISTA-Gym, a scalable training environment for incentivizing tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities in VLMs. VISTA-Gym unifies diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks (7 tasks from 13 datasets in total) with a standardized interface for visual tools (e.g., grounding, parsing), executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning at scale. While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.",human
"Large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved embodied question answering (EQA) agents by providing strong semantic priors for open-vocabulary reasoning. However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines. Overall, our method achieves better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets on both OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.",human
"The validation of a data-driven model is the process of assessing the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data in the population of interest. This paper proposes a set of general rules for model validation. These rules are designed to help practitioners create reliable validation plans and report their results transparently. While no validation scheme is flawless, these rules can help practitioners ensure their strategy is sufficient for practical use, openly discuss any limitations of their validation strategy, and report clear, comparable performance metrics.",human
"In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents are increasingly used to generate software across a wide range of domains. Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.",human
"Language understanding entails not just extracting the surface-level meaning of the linguistic input, but constructing rich mental models of the situation it describes. Here we propose that because processing within the brain's core language system is fundamentally limited, deeply understanding language requires exporting information from the language system to other brain regions that compute perceptual and motor representations, construct mental models, and store our world knowledge and autobiographical memories. We review the existing evidence for this hypothesis, and argue that recent progress in cognitive neuroscience provides both the conceptual foundation and the methods to directly test it, thus opening up a new strategy to reveal what it means, cognitively and neurally, to understand language.",human
"Clustering is widely used in unsupervised learning to find homogeneous groups of observations within a dataset. However, clustering mixed-type data remains a challenge, as few existing approaches are suited for this task. This study presents the state-of-the-art of these approaches and compares them using various simulation models. The compared methods include the distance-based approaches k-prototypes, PDQ, and convex k-means, and the probabilistic methods KAy-means for MIxed LArge data (KAMILA), the mixture of Bayesian networks (MBNs), and latent class model (LCM). The aim is to provide insights into the behavior of different methods across a wide range of scenarios by varying some experimental factors such as the number of clusters, cluster overlap, sample size, dimension, proportion of continuous variables in the dataset, and clusters' distribution. The degree of cluster overlap and the proportion of continuous variables in the dataset and the sample size have a significant impact on the observed performances. When strong interactions exist between variables alongside an explicit dependence on cluster membership, none of the evaluated methods demonstrated satisfactory performance. In our experiments KAMILA, LCM, and k-prototypes exhibited the best performance, with respect to the adjusted rand index (ARI). All the methods are available in R.",human
"Despite the promise of computational pathology foundation models, adapting them to specific clinical tasks remains challenging due to the complexity of whole-slide image (WSI) processing, the opacity of learned features, and the wide range of potential adaptation strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce PathFMTools, a lightweight, extensible Python package that enables efficient execution, analysis, and visualization of pathology foundation models. We use this tool to interface with and evaluate two state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models, CONCH and MUSK, on the task of histological grading in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a critical criterion that informs cSCC staging and patient management. Using a cohort of 440 cSCC H&E WSIs, we benchmark multiple adaptation strategies, demonstrating trade-offs across prediction approaches and validating the potential of using foundation model embeddings to train small specialist models. These findings underscore the promise of pathology foundation models for real-world clinical applications, with PathFMTools enabling efficient analysis and validation.",human
"Data is often impractical to share for a range of well considered reasons, such as concerns over privacy, intellectual property, and legal constraints. This not only fragments the statistical power of predictive models, but creates an accessibility bias, where accuracy becomes inequitably distributed to those who have the resources to overcome these concerns. We present DISCO: an open-source DIStributed COllaborative learning platform accessible to non-technical users, offering a means to collaboratively build machine learning models without sharing any original data or requiring any programming knowledge. DISCO's web application trains models locally directly in the browser, making our tool cross-platform out-of-the-box, including smartphones. The modular design of \disco offers choices between federated and decentralized paradigms, various levels of privacy guarantees and several approaches to weight aggregation strategies that allow for model personalization and bias resilience in the collaborative training.

"As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance. Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.",human
"Transformers face scalability challenges due to the quadratic cost of attention, which involves dense similarity computations between queries and keys. We propose CAMformer, a novel accelerator that reinterprets attention as an associative memory operation and computes attention scores using a voltage-domain Binary Attention Content Addressable Memory (BA-CAM). This enables constant-time similarity search through analog charge sharing, replacing digital arithmetic with physical similarity sensing. CAMformer integrates hierarchical two-stage top-k filtering, pipelined execution, and high-precision contextualization to achieve both algorithmic accuracy and architectural efficiency. Evaluated on BERT and Vision Transformer workloads, CAMformer achieves over 10x energy efficiency, up to 4x higher throughput, and 6-8x lower area compared to state-of-the-art accelerators--while maintaining near-lossless accuracy.",human
"Domain-specific text embeddings are critical for clinical natural language processing, yet systematic comparisons across model architectures remain limited. This study evaluates ten transformer-based embedding models adapted for cardiology through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on 106,535 cardiology text pairs derived from authoritative medical textbooks. Results demonstrate that encoder-only architectures, particularly BioLinkBERT, achieve superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) compared to larger decoder-based models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. The findings challenge the assumption that larger language models necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings and provide practical guidance for clinical NLP system development. All models, training code, and evaluation datasets are publicly available to support reproducible research in medical informatics.",human
"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been the cornerstone of clinical evidence; however, their cost, duration, and restrictive eligibility criteria limit power and external validity. Studies using real-world data (RWD), historically considered less reliable for establishing causality, are now recognized to be important for generating real-world evidence (RWE). In parallel, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are being increasingly used throughout the drug development process, providing scalability and flexibility but also presenting challenges in interpretability and rigor that traditional statistics do not face. This Perspective argues that the future of evidence generation will not depend on RCTs versus RWD, or statistics versus AI/ML, but on their principled integration. To this end, a causal roadmap is needed to clarify inferential goals, make assumptions explicit, and ensure transparency about tradeoffs. We highlight key objectives of integrative evidence synthesis, including transporting RCT results to broader populations, embedding AI-assisted analyses within RCTs, designing hybrid controlled trials, and extending short-term RCTs with long-term RWD. We also outline future directions in privacy-preserving analytics, uncertainty quantification, and small-sample methods. By uniting statistical rigor with AI/ML innovation, integrative approaches can produce robust, transparent, and policy-relevant evidence, making them a key component of modern regulatory science.",human
"Active learning (AL) accelerates scientific discovery by prioritizing the most informative experiments, but traditional machine learning (ML) models used in AL suffer from cold-start limitations and domain-specific feature engineering, restricting their generalizability. Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven autonomous discovery.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, representing the most significant security threat in production deployments. We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security.",human
"Multi-agent systems often operate under feedback, adaptation, and non-stationarity, yet many simulation studies retain static decision rules and fixed control parameters. This paper introduces a general adaptive multi-agent learning framework that integrates: (i) four dynamic regimes distinguishing static versus adaptive agents and fixed versus adaptive system parameters; (ii) information-theoretic diagnostics (entropy rate, statistical complexity, and predictive information) to assess predictability and structure; (iii) structural causal models for explicit intervention semantics; (iv) procedures for generating agent-level priors from aggregate or sample data; and (v) unsupervised methods for identifying emergent behavioral regimes. The framework offers a domain-neutral architecture for analyzing how learning agents and adaptive controls jointly shape system trajectories, enabling systematic comparison of stability, performance, and interpretability across non-equilibrium, oscillatory, or drifting dynamics. Mathematical definitions, computational operators, and an experimental design template are provided, yielding a structured methodology for developing explainable and contestable multi-agent decision processes.",human
"Socioeconomic segregation often arises in school districting and other contexts, causing some groups to be over- or under-represented within a particular district. This phenomenon is closely linked with disparities in opportunities and outcomes. We formulate a new class of geographical partitioning problems in which the population is heterogeneous, and it is necessary to ensure fair representation for each group at each facility. We prove that the optimal solution is a novel generalization of the additively weighted Voronoi diagram, and we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to compute it, thus resolving an open question dating back to Dvoretzky et al. (1951). The efficacy and potential for practical insight of the approach are demonstrated in a realistic case study involving seven demographic groups and $78$ district offices.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate self-explanations alongside their predictions, a practice that raises concerns about the faithfulness of these explanations, especially in low-resource languages. This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments. These results highlight the limitations of current explanation methods and metrics, emphasizing the need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts.",human
"Community detection, or network clustering, is used to identify latent community structure in networks. Due to the scarcity of labeled ground truth in real-world networks, evaluating these algorithms poses significant challenges. To address this, researchers use synthetic network generators that produce networks with ground-truth community labels. RECCS is one such algorithm that takes a network and its clustering as input and generates a synthetic network through a modular pipeline. Each generated ground truth cluster preserves key characteristics of the corresponding input cluster, including connectivity, minimum degree, and degree sequence distribution. The output consists of a synthetically generated network, and disjoint ground truth cluster labels for all nodes. In this paper, we present two enhanced versions: RECCS+ and RECCS++. RECCS+ maintains algorithmic fidelity to the original RECCS while introducing parallelization through an orchestrator that coordinates algorithmic components across multiple processes and employs multithreading. RECCS++ builds upon this foundation with additional algorithmic optimizations to achieve further speedup. Our experimental results demonstrate that RECCS+ and RECCS++ achieve speedups of up to 49x and 139x respectively on our benchmark datasets, with RECCS++'s additional performance gains involving a modest accuracy tradeoff. With this newfound performance, RECCS++ can now scale to networks with over 100 million nodes and nearly 2 billion edges.",human
"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often slows in the late stage of training due to anisotropic curvature and gradient noise. We analyze preconditioned SGD in the geometry induced by a symmetric positive definite matrix $\mathbf{M}$, deriving bounds in which both the convergence rate and the stochastic noise floor are governed by $\mathbf{M}$-dependent quantities: the rate through an effective condition number in the $\mathbf{M}$-metric, and the floor through the product of that condition number and the preconditioned noise level. For nonconvex objectives, we establish a preconditioner-dependent basin-stability guarantee: when smoothness and basin size are measured in the $\mathbf{M}$-norm, the probability that the iterates remain in a well-behaved local region admits an explicit lower bound. This perspective is particularly relevant in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), where achieving small training loss under stochastic updates is closely tied to physical fidelity, numerical stability, and constraint satisfaction. The framework applies to both diagonal/adaptive and curvature-aware preconditioners and yields a simple design principle: choose $\mathbf{M}$ to improve local conditioning while attenuating noise. Experiments on a quadratic diagnostic and three SciML benchmarks validate the predicted rate-floor behavior.",human
"Machine learning (ML) involves private data and proprietary model parameters. MPC-based ML allows multiple parties to collaboratively run an ML workload without sharing their private data or model parameters using multi-party computing (MPC). Because MPC cannot natively run ML operations such as Softmax or GELU, existing frameworks use different approximations. Our study shows that, on a well-optimized framework, these approximations often become the dominating bottleneck. Popular approximations are often insufficiently accurate or unnecessarily slow, and these issues are hard to identify and fix in existing frameworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a compiler for MPC-based ML, CrypTorch. CrypTorch disentangles these approximations with the rest of the MPC runtime, allows easily adding new approximations through its programming interface, and automatically selects approximations to maximize both performance and accuracy. Built as an extension to PyTorch 2's compiler, we show that CrypTorch's auto-tuning alone provides 1.20--1.7$\times$ immediate speedup without sacrificing accuracy, and 1.31--1.8$\times$ speedup when some accuracy degradation is allowed, compared to our well-optimized baseline. Combined with better engineering and adoption of state-of-the-art practices, the entire framework brings 3.22--8.6$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the popular framework, CrypTen.",human
"Post-training quantization is an effective method for reducing the serving cost of large language models, where the standard approach is to use a round-to-nearest quantization level scheme. However, this often introduces large errors due to outliers in the weights. Proposed mitigation mechanisms include applying adaptive rounding, random rotation transformations or committing to a post-training target using calibration data. Unfortunately, this reliance on calibration data can be severely limiting in some real-world scenarios as such data may be unavailable or subject to privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose algorithms to optimize transformations and adaptive rounding without access to any calibration data. The optimization is achieved by designing a suitable proxy function for the quantization loss without calibration data. To maintain inference efficiency, we perform structured matrix transformations for single matrices. For paired weights that interact directly in the computation graph, we use dual matrix transformations and adaptive rounding methods. We conduct experiments on Gemma 2 models, and observe consistent improvement over the baselines. For Gemma 2 9B quantization, our method improves the average benchmark score from 61.9 to 62.4 for 4-bit quantization and from 52.0 to 60.6 for 3-bit quantization, while adding less than 3% of computation overhead. Furthermore, our method achieves performance comparable to the commonly used GPTQ method, which requires calibration data.",human

"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements and the ability to learn domain-specific languages (DSLs), including APIs and tool interfaces. This capability has enabled the creation of AI agents that can perform preliminary computations and act through tool calling, now being standardized via protocols like MCP. However, LLMs face fundamental limitations: their context windows cannot grow indefinitely, constraining their memory and computational capacity. Agent collaboration emerges as essential for solving increasingly complex problems, mirroring how computational systems rely on different types of memory to scale. The ""Internet of Agents"" (IoA) represents the communication stack that enables agents to scale by distributing computation across collaborating entities.   Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}. L8 formalizes the \textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a ""Shared Context"" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction. Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.",human
"The ubiquity of time series data creates a strong demand for general-purpose foundation models, yet developing them for classification remains a significant challenge, largely due to the high cost of labeled data. Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance. Extensive evaluations on the UCR Archive show that TiCT achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods. Crucially, this is accomplished using only in-context examples at inference time, without updating a single model weight.",human
"Payment networks form the backbone of modern commerce, generating high volumes of transaction records from daily activities.

"We introduce IndEgo, a multimodal egocentric and exocentric dataset addressing common industrial tasks, including assembly/disassembly, logistics and organisation, inspection and repair, woodworking, and others. The dataset contains 3,460 egocentric recordings (approximately 197 hours), along with 1,092 exocentric recordings (approximately 97 hours). A key focus of the dataset is collaborative work, where two workers jointly perform cognitively and physically intensive tasks. The egocentric recordings include rich multimodal data and added context via eye gaze, narration, sound, motion, and others. We provide detailed annotations (actions, summaries, mistake annotations, narrations), metadata, processed outputs (eye gaze, hand pose, semi-dense point cloud), and benchmarks on procedural and non-procedural task understanding, Mistake Detection, and reasoning-based Question Answering.

"Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.   In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.   We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.",human
"Financial applications of large language models (LLMs) require factual reliability and computational efficiency, yet current systems often hallucinate details and depend on prohibitively large models.

Our method is based on constructing a cascade of time-dependent variational lower bounds on the data log-likelihood, that provably improves upon the standard evidence lower bound and results in reduced data-model KL-divergences. Combining such bounds gives rise to reweighted objectives that can be applied to any generative diffusion model including both continuous Gaussian diffusion and masked (discrete) diffusion models. Then, we showcase this framework in masked diffusion and report significant improvements over previous training losses in pixel-space image modeling, approaching sample quality comparable to continuous diffusion models. Our results also provide a theoretical justification for the simple weighting scheme widely used in masked image models.",human
"Progress in computer use agents (CUAs) has been constrained by the absence of large and high-quality datasets that capture how humans interact with a computer. While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models. We are making Fara-7B open-weight on Microsoft Foundry and HuggingFace, and we are releasing WebTailBench.",human
"Time-series forecasting remains difficult in real-world settings because temporal patterns operate at multiple scales, from broad contextual trends to fast, fine-grained fluctuations that drive critical decisions. Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios. By strengthening the reliability and interpretability of fine-scale temporal predictions, this framework contributes to more trustworthy AI systems used in forecasting-driven decision support across energy, infrastructure, and other time-critical domains.",human
"Although upper bound guarantees for bilevel optimization have been widely studied, progress on lower bounds has been limited due to the complexity of the bilevel structure. In this work, we focus on the smooth nonconvex-strongly-convex setting and develop new hard instances that yield nontrivial lower bounds under deterministic and stochastic first-order oracle models. In the deterministic case, we prove that any first-order zero-respecting algorithm requires at least $Ω(κ^{3/2}ε^{-2})$ oracle calls to find an $ε$-accurate stationary point, improving the optimal lower bounds known for single-level nonconvex optimization and for nonconvex-strongly-convex min-max problems. In the stochastic case, we show that at least $Ω(κ^{5/2}ε^{-4})$ stochastic oracle calls are necessary, again strengthening the best known bounds in related settings. Our results expose substantial gaps between current upper and lower bounds for bilevel optimization and suggest that even simplified regimes, such as those with quadratic lower-level objectives, warrant further investigation toward understanding the optimal complexity of bilevel optimization under standard first-order oracles.",human
"This study examines whether Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can approximate the performance of fully fine-tuned models in generating human-interpretable decisions and explanations for malware classification. Achieving trustworthy malware detection, particularly when LLMs are involved, remains a significant challenge. We developed an evaluation framework using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), and Semantic Similarity Metrics to benchmark explanation quality across five LoRA configurations and a fully fine-tuned baseline. Results indicate that full fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores, with BLEU and ROUGE improvements of up to 10% over LoRA variants. However, mid-range LoRA models deliver competitive performance exceeding full fine-tuning on two metrics while reducing model size by approximately 81% and training time by over 80% on a LoRA model with 15.5% trainable parameters. These findings demonstrate that LoRA offers a practical balance of interpretability and resource efficiency, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments without sacrificing explanation quality. By providing feature-driven natural language explanations for malware classifications, this approach enhances transparency, analyst confidence, and operational scalability in malware detection systems.",human
"Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.",human
"The ever-increasing number of Android devices and the accelerated evolution of malware, reaching over 35 million samples by 2024, highlight the critical importance of effective detection methods. Attackers are now using Artificial Intelligence to create sophisticated malware variations that can easily evade traditional detection techniques. Although machine learning has shown promise in malware classification, its success relies heavily on the availability of up-to-date, high-quality datasets. The scarcity and high cost of obtaining and labeling real malware samples presents significant challenges in developing robust detection models. In this paper, we propose MalSynGen, a Malware Synthetic Data Generation methodology that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data. This data preserves the statistical properties of real-world data and improves the performance of Android malware classifiers. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using various datasets and metrics that assess the fidelity of the generated data, its utility in classification, and the computational efficiency of the process. Our experiments demonstrate that MalSynGen can generalize across different datasets, providing a viable solution to address the issues of obsolescence and low quality data in malware detection.",human
"Multi-hop question answering over knowledge graphs remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible reasoning paths. Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.",human
"Foundation models (FM) have unlocked powerful zero-shot capabilities in vision and language, yet their reliance on internet pretraining data leaves them brittle in unstructured, real-world settings. The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

"Modern enterprise systems face escalating cyber threats that are increasingly dynamic, distributed, and multi-stage in nature. Traditional intrusion detection and response systems often rely on static rules and manual workflows, which limit their ability to respond with the speed and precision required in high-stakes environments. To address these challenges, we present the Intrusion Response System Digital Assistant (IRSDA), an agent-based framework designed to deliver autonomous and policy-compliant cyber defense. IRSDA combines Self-Adaptive Autonomic Computing Systems (SA-ACS) with the Knowledge guided Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute (MAPE-K) loop to support real-time, partition-aware decision-making across enterprise infrastructure.   IRSDA incorporates a knowledge-driven architecture that integrates contextual information with AI-based reasoning to support system-guided intrusion response. The framework leverages retrieval mechanisms and structured representations to inform decision-making while maintaining alignment with operational policies. We assess the system using a representative real-world microservices application, demonstrating its ability to automate containment, enforce compliance, and provide traceable outputs for security analyst interpretation. This work outlines a modular and agent-driven approach to cyber defense that emphasizes explainability, system-state awareness, and operational control in intrusion response.",human
"Purpose: To investigate whether a vision-language foundation model can enhance undersampled MRI reconstruction by providing high-level contextual information beyond conventional priors. Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework. Conclusion: The study highlights that vision-language foundation models can improve undersampled MRI reconstruction through semantic-space optimization.",human
"Modern neural networks rarely have a single way to be right. For many tasks, multiple models can achieve identical performance while relying on different features or reasoning patterns, a property known as the Rashomon Effect. However, uncovering this diversity in deep architectures is challenging as their continuous parameter spaces contain countless near-optimal solutions that are numerically distinct but often behaviorally similar. We introduce Rashomon Concept Bottleneck Models, a framework that learns multiple neural networks which are all accurate yet reason through distinct human-understandable concepts. By combining lightweight adapter modules with a diversity-regularized training objective, our method constructs a diverse set of deep concept-based models efficiently without retraining from scratch. The resulting networks provide fundamentally different reasoning processes for the same predictions, revealing how concept reliance and decision making vary across equally performing solutions. Our framework enables systematic exploration of data-driven reasoning diversity in deep models, offering a new mechanism for auditing, comparison, and alignment across equally accurate solutions.",human
"LLM-based coding agents are increasingly common but still face challenges in context management, latency, reliability, reproducibility, and scalability. We present Agint, an agentic graph compiler, interpreter, and runtime that incrementally and hierarchically converts natural-language instructions into typed, effect-aware code DAGs. Agint introduces explicit type floors (text to data to spec to code) grounded in semantic graph transformations and a hybrid LLM and function-based JIT runtime. This enables dynamic graph refinement, reproducible and optimizable execution, speculative evaluation, and interoperability with existing developer tools. Agint's typed graph bindings improve reliability and allow concurrent composition of concurrent codebases by construction, supporting accelerated development with smaller and faster models, lower latency, efficient context utilization, and higher throughput. Hierarchical compilation allows scalable graph edits, while the graph structure supports reproducibility and efficient parallel generation. Agint provides a composable unix-style toolchain: dagify (DAG compiler), dagent (hybrid JIT runtime), schemagin (schema generator), and datagin (data transformer) for realtime, low-latency code and dataflow creation. Human developers and coding agents refine graphs through the Agint CLI, while non-technical users use Agint Flow GUI for visual editing, conversational refinement, and debugging to promote prototype agentic workflows to production code. This continuous co-creation model allows teams to prototype quickly, refine seamlessly, and deploy reliably, bridging natural language, compiler methods, and developer tooling to enable a new generation of composable, team-centric coding agents at scale.",human
"This study investigates the limitations of applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to arbitrary objective functions, focusing on a two-block MCMC framework which alternates between Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling. While such approaches are often considered advantageous for enabling data-driven regularization, we show that their performance critically depends on the sharpness of the employed likelihood form. By introducing a sharpness parameter and exploring alternative likelihood formulations proportional to the target objective function, we demonstrate how likelihood curvature governs both in-sample performance and the degree of regularization inferred by the training data. Empirical applications are conducted on reinforcement learning tasks: including a navigation problem and the game of tic-tac-toe. The study concludes with a separate analysis examining the implications of extreme likelihood sharpness on arbitrary objective functions stemming from the classic game of blackjack, where the first block of the two-block MCMC framework is replaced with an iterative optimization step. The resulting hybrid approach achieves performance nearly identical to the original MCMC framework, indicating that excessive likelihood sharpness effectively collapses posterior mass onto a single dominant mode.",human
"We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.",human
"Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.",human
"Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

"State-of-the-art flow models achieve remarkable quality but require slow, iterative sampling. To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step. We hope our work establishes a more robust paradigm for accelerating generative models and motivates the broader adoption of flow map distillation without data.",human
"AI-Integrated programming is emerging as a foundational paradigm for building intelligent systems with large language models (LLMs). Recent approaches such as Meaning Typed Programming (MTP) automate prompt generation by leveraging the semantics already present in code. However, many real-world applications depend on contextual cues, developer intent, and domain-specific reasoning that extend beyond what static code semantics alone can express. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation. We further introduce a benchmark suite designed to reflect realistic AI-Integrated application scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Semantic Engineering substantially improves prompt fidelity, achieving performance comparable to Prompt Engineering while requiring significantly less developer effort.",human
"General-purpose control demands agents that act across many tasks and embodiments, yet research on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control remains dominated by single-task or offline regimes, reinforcing a view that online RL does not scale. Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks. Experiments show that Newt yields better multitask performance and data-efficiency than a set of strong baselines, exhibits strong open-loop control, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks. We release our environments, demonstrations, code for training and evaluation, as well as 200+ checkpoints.",human
"We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.",human
"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown very impressive capabilities in code generation across many programming languages. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs generate programs that contains syntactic errors and fail to complete the given tasks, especially for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs). In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator. Notably, SLMFix brings substantial improvement to the base model and outperforms supervised finetuning approach even for 7B models on a LRPL, showing the potential of our approach as an alternative to traditional finetuning approaches.",human
"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.",human
"Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked concerns over their potential to acquire and misuse dangerous or high-risk capabilities, posing frontier risks. Current safety evaluations primarily test for what a model \textit{can} do - its capabilities - without assessing what it $\textit{would}$ do if endowed with high-risk capabilities. This leaves a critical blind spot: models may strategically conceal capabilities or rapidly acquire them, while harboring latent inclinations toward misuse. We argue that $\textbf{propensity}$ - the likelihood of a model to pursue harmful actions if empowered - is a critical, yet underexplored, axis of safety evaluation. We present $\textbf{PropensityBench}$, a novel benchmark framework that assesses the proclivity of models to engage in risky behaviors when equipped with simulated dangerous capabilities using proxy tools. Our framework includes 5,874 scenarios with 6,648 tools spanning four high-risk domains: cybersecurity, self-proliferation, biosecurity, and chemical security. We simulate access to powerful capabilities via a controlled agentic environment and evaluate the models' choices under varying operational pressures that reflect real-world constraints or incentives models may encounter, such as resource scarcity or gaining more autonomy. Across open-source and proprietary frontier models, we uncover 9 alarming signs of propensity: models frequently choose high-risk tools when under pressure, despite lacking the capability to execute such actions unaided. These findings call for a shift from static capability audits toward dynamic propensity assessments as a prerequisite for deploying frontier AI systems safely. Our code is available at https://github.com/scaleapi/propensity-evaluation.",human
"As agentic AI becomes more widespread, agents with distinct and possibly conflicting goals will interact in complex ways. These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents.",human
"We study the problem of nonparametric instrumental variable regression with observed covariates, which we refer to as NPIV-O. Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O.",human
"Large-scale video generative models have recently demonstrated strong visual capabilities, enabling the prediction of future frames that adhere to the logical and physical cues in the current observation. In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.",human
"Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.",human
"This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature.   In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions.",human
"Advances in object tracking and acoustic beamforming are driving new capabilities in surveillance, human-computer interaction, and robotics. This work presents an embedded system that integrates deep learning-based tracking with beamforming to achieve precise sound source localization and directional audio capture in dynamic environments. The approach combines single-camera depth estimation and stereo vision to enable accurate 3D localization of moving objects. A planar concentric circular microphone array constructed with MEMS microphones provides a compact, energy-efficient platform supporting 2D beam steering across azimuth and elevation. Real-time tracking outputs continuously adapt the array's focus, synchronizing the acoustic response with the target's position. By uniting learned spatial awareness with dynamic steering, the system maintains robust performance in the presence of multiple or moving sources. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant gains in signal-to-interference ratio, making the design well-suited for teleconferencing, smart home devices, and assistive technologies.",human
"Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.",human
"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly used in education, posing significant challenges for teachers adapting to these changes. GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for accessibility, scalability and productivity in educational tasks. However, the automation of teaching tasks through GenAI raises concerns about reduced teacher agency, potential cognitive atrophy, and the broader deprofessionalisation of teaching. Drawing findings from prior literature on AI in Education, and refining through a recent systematic literature review, this chapter presents a conceptualisation of five levels of teacher-AI teaming: transactional, situational, operational, praxical and synergistic teaming. The framework aims to capture the nuanced dynamics of teacher-AI interactions, particularly with GenAI, that may lead to the replacement, complementarity, or augmentation of teachers' competences and professional practice. GenAI technological affordances required in supporting teaming, along with empirical studies, are discussed. Drawing on empirical observations, we outline a future vision that moves beyond individual teacher agency toward collaborative decision-making between teachers and AI, in which both agents engage in negotiation, constructive challenge, and co-reasoning that enhance each other's capabilities and enable outcomes neither could realise independently. Further discussion of socio-technical factors beyond teacher-AI teaming is also included to streamline the synergy of teachers and AI in education ethically and practically.",human
"Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.",human
"Chronic pain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD) are common and interrelated chronic medical conditions. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.",human
"Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have established a new state-of-the-art in generative image synthesis, yet their deployment is hindered by significant computational overhead during inference, often requiring up to 1,000 iterative steps. This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of DDPMs against the emerging Flow Matching (Rectified Flow) paradigm, specifically isolating their geometric and efficiency properties on low-resource hardware. By implementing both frameworks on a shared Time-Conditioned U-Net backbone using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that Flow Matching significantly outperforms Diffusion in efficiency. Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\mathcal{C} \approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\mathcal{C} \approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}",human
"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications. While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.",human
"Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable ""black box"" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.",human
"This paper presents HunyuanOCR, a commercial-grade, open-source, and lightweight (1B parameters) Vision-Language Model (VLM) dedicated to OCR tasks. The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.   HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow ""OCR expert models"" and inefficient ""General VLMs"". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.   HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.",human
"Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/DeCo.",human
"Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.",human
"Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a powerful statistical framework for high-stakes classification applications. Instead of predicting a single class, CP generates a prediction set, guaranteed to include the true label with a pre-specified probability. The performance of different CP methods is typically assessed by their average prediction set size. In setups where the classes can be partitioned into semantic groups, e.g., diseases that require similar treatment, users can benefit from prediction sets that are not only small on average, but also contain a small number of semantically different groups. This paper begins by addressing this problem and ultimately offers a widely applicable tool for boosting any CP method on any dataset. First, given a class partition, we propose augmenting the CP score function with a term that penalizes predictions with out-of-group errors. We theoretically analyze this strategy and prove its advantages for group-related metrics. Surprisingly, we show mathematically that, for common class partitions, it can also reduce the average set size of any CP score function. Our analysis reveals the class similarity factors behind this improvement and motivates us to propose a model-specific variant, which does not require any human semantic partition and can further reduce the prediction set size. Finally, we present an extensive empirical study, encompassing prominent CP methods, multiple models, and several datasets, which demonstrates that our class-similarity-based approach consistently enhances CP methods.",human
"The challenge of designing effective reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) represents a significant bottleneck, often requiring extensive human expertise and being time-consuming. Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.",human
"Clustering short text embeddings is a foundational task in natural language processing, yet remains challenging due to the need to specify the number of clusters in advance. We introduce a scalable spectral method that estimates the number of clusters directly from the structure of the Laplacian eigenspectrum, constructed using cosine similarities and guided by an adaptive sampling strategy. This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background. It has an information-theoretic motivation inspired by mutual information, and in our experiments it correlates closely with extrinsic measures such as normalized mutual information and homogeneity. Extensive experiments on six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden. These results demonstrate the practical value of our spectral estimator and Cohesion Ratio for unsupervised organization and evaluation of short text data. Implementation of our estimator of k and Cohesion Ratio, along with code for reproducing the experiments, is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/towards_clustering-0C2E.",human
"Neural models have shown promise in solving NP-hard graph combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Once trained, they offer fast inference and reasonably high-quality solutions for in-distribution testing instances, but they generally fall short in terms of absolute solution quality compared to classical search-based algorithms that are admittedly slower but offer optimality guarantee once search finishes.   We propose a novel framework that combines the inference efficiency and exploratory power of neural models with the solution quality guarantee of search-based algorithms. In particular, we use parameterized algorithms (PAs) as the search component. PAs are dedicated to identifying easy instances of generally NP-hard problems, and allow for practically efficient search by exploiting structural simplicity (of the identified easy instances). Under our framework, we use parameterized analysis to identify the structurally hard parts of a CO instance. The neural model handles the hard parts by generating advisory signals based on its data-driven understanding. The PA-based search component then integrates the advisory signals to systematically and efficiently searches through the remaining structurally easy parts. Notably, our framework is agnostic to the choice of neural model and produces strictly better solutions than neural solvers alone.   We examine our framework on multiple CO tasks. Empirical results show that it achieves superior solution quality, competitive with that of commercial solvers. Furthermore, by using the neural model only for exploratory advisory signals, our framework exhibits improved out-of-distribution generalization, addressing a key limitation of existing neural CO solvers.",human
"The discovery of high-performance photosensitizers has long been hindered by the time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of traditional trial-and-error approaches. Here, we present \textbf{A}I-\textbf{A}ccelerated \textbf{P}hoto\textbf{S}ensitizer \textbf{I}nnovation (AAPSI), a closed-loop workflow that integrates expert knowledge, scaffold-based molecule generation, and Bayesian optimization to accelerate the design of novel photosensitizers. The scaffold-driven generation in AAPSI ensures structural novelty and synthetic feasibility, while the iterative AI-experiment loop accelerates the discovery of novel photosensitizers. AAPSI leverages a curated database of 102,534 photosensitizer-solvent pairs and generate 6,148 synthetically accessible candidates. These candidates are screened via graph transformers trained to predict singlet oxygen quantum yield ($φ_Δ$) and absorption maxima ($λ_{max}$), following experimental validation. This work generates several novel candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), among which the hypocrellin-based candidate HB4Ph exhibits exceptional performance at the Pareto frontier of high quantum yield of singlet oxygen and long absorption maxima among current photosensitizers ($φ_Δ$=0.85, $λ_{max}$=650nm).",human
"Despite significant progress in continual learning ranging from architectural novelty to clever strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting most existing methods rest on a strong but unrealistic assumption the availability of labeled data throughout the learning process. In real-world scenarios, however, data often arrives sequentially and without annotations, rendering conventional approaches impractical. In this work, we revisit the fundamental assumptions of continual learning and ask: Can current systems adapt when labels are absent and tasks emerge incrementally over time? To this end, we introduce Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning (AFCIL), a more realistic and challenging paradigm where unlabeled data arrives continuously, and the learner must incrementally acquire new classes without any supervision. To enable effective learning under AFCIL, we propose CrossWorld CL, a Cross Domain World Guided Continual Learning framework that incorporates external world knowledge as a stable auxiliary source. The method retrieves semantically related ImageNet classes for each downstream category, maps downstream and ImageNet features through a cross domain alignment strategy and finally introduce a novel replay strategy. This design lets the model uncover semantic structure without annotations while keeping earlier knowledge intact. Across four datasets, CrossWorld-CL surpasses CLIP baselines and existing continual and unlabeled learning methods, underscoring the benefit of world knowledge for annotation free continual learning.",human
"State-of-the-art symbolic music generation models have recently achieved remarkable output quality, yet explicit control over compositional features, such as tonal tension, remains challenging. We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve. Objective evaluations indicate that our approach effectively modulates tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system produces outputs that align with the target tension. These results demonstrate that explicit tension conditioning through a dual-level beam search provides a powerful and intuitive tool to guide AI-generated music. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our method can generate multiple distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition.",human
"High-throughput methods enable accelerated discovery of novel materials in complex systems such as high-entropy alloys, which exhibit intricate phase stability across vast compositional spaces. Computational approaches, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD), facilitate screening of phase formability as a function of composition and temperature. However, the integration of computational predictions with experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature to ~1000 °C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation. This integrated approach demonstrates where strong overall agreement between computation and experiment exists, while also identifying key discrepancies, particularly in FCC/BCC predictions at Mn-rich regions to inform future model refinement.",human
"Language model inversion (LMI), i.e., recovering hidden prompts from outputs, emerges as a concrete threat to user privacy and system security. We recast LMI as reusing the LLM's own latent space and propose the Invariant Latent Space Hypothesis (ILSH): (1) diverse outputs from the same source prompt should preserve consistent semantics (source invariance), and (2) input<->output cyclic mappings should be self-consistent within a shared latent space (cyclic invariance). Accordingly, we present Inv^2A, which treats the LLM as an invariant decoder and learns only a lightweight inverse encoder that maps outputs to a denoised pseudo-representation. When multiple outputs are available, they are sparsely concatenated at the representation layer to increase information density. Training proceeds in two stages: contrastive alignment (source invariance) and supervised reinforcement (cyclic invariance). An optional training-free neighborhood search can refine local performance. Across 9 datasets covering user and system prompt scenarios, Inv^2A outperforms baselines by an average of 4.77% BLEU score while reducing dependence on large inverse corpora. Our analysis further shows that prevalent defenses provide limited protection, underscoring the need for stronger strategies. The source code and data involved in this paper can be found in https://github.com/yyy01/Invariant_Attacker.",human
"Test-time scaling, which leverages additional computation during inference to improve model accuracy, has enabled a new class of Large Language Models (LLMs) that are able to reason through complex problems by understanding the goal, turning this goal into a plan, working through intermediate steps, and checking their own work before answering . Frontier large language models with reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's gpt-oss, follow the same procedure when solving complex problems by generating intermediate reasoning traces before giving the final answer. Today, these models are being increasingly used to generate reasoning traces that serve as high-quality supervised data for post-training of small and medium-sized language models to teach reasoning capabilities without requiring expensive human curation. In this work, we compare the performance of medium-sized LLMs on Math problems after post-training on two kinds of reasoning traces. We compare the impact of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1 and gpt-oss LLMs in terms of accuracy and inference efficiency.",human
"A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline.",human
"While transformers can discover latent structure from context, the dynamics of how they acquire different components of the latent structure remain poorly understood. In this work, we use the Alchemy benchmark, to investigate the dynamics of latent structure learning. We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training.",human
"Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed. Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.",human
"Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) enables access to multilingual knowledge but remains challenging due to disparities in resources, scripts, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment in embedding models. Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages.",human
"This study developed a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset to generate concise summaries of Bangla articles from diverse sources. Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.",human
"Recent fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models enable them to reproduce specific image sets, such as particular faces or artistic styles, but also introduce copyright and security risks. Dataset watermarking has been proposed to ensure traceability by embedding imperceptible watermarks into training images, which remain detectable in outputs even after fine-tuning. However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research.",human
"Information-seeking is a core capability for AI agents, requiring them to gather and reason over tool-generated information across long trajectories. However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.",human
"Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning. The code is avaiable at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/AutoEnv.",human
"Novel deep learning architectures are increasingly being applied to biological data, including genetic sequences. These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs.",human
"TorchQuantumDistributed (tqd) is a PyTorch-based [Paszke et al., 2019] library for accelerator-agnostic differentiable quantum state vector simulation at scale.

"Estimating quantum entropies and divergences is an important problem in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|Θ(\mathcal{U})|\mathrm{polylog}(d)/ε^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice.",human

"This chapter seeks to frame the elemental and invisible problems of AI and big data in the African context by examining digital sites and infrastructure through the lens of power and interests. It will present reflections on how these sites are using AI recommendation algorithms to recreate new digital societies in the region, how they have the potential to propagate algorithmic colonialism and negative gender norms, and what this means for the regional sustainable development agenda. The chapter proposes adopting business models that embrace response-ability and consider the existence of alternative socio-material worlds of AI. These reflections will mainly come from ongoing discussions with Kenyan social media users in this authors' user space talks, personal experiences and six months of active participant observations done by the authors.",human
"A cognitive map is an internal model which encodes the abstract relationships among entities in the world, giving humans and animals the flexibility to adapt to new situations, with a strong out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization that current AI systems still do not possess. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale.",human
"Global greenhouse gas emissions estimates are essential for monitoring and mitigation planning. Yet most datasets lack one or more characteristics that enhance their actionability, such as accuracy, global coverage, high spatial and temporal resolution, and frequent updates. To address these gaps, we present Climate TRACE (climatetrace.org), an open-access platform delivering global emissions estimates with enhanced detail, coverage, and timeliness. Climate TRACE synthesizes existing emissions data, prioritizing accuracy, coverage, and resolution, and fills gaps using sector-specific estimation approaches. The dataset is the first to provide globally comprehensive emissions estimates for individual sources (e.g., individual power plants) for all anthropogenic emitting sectors. The dataset spans January 1, 2021, to the present, with a two-month reporting lag and monthly updates. The open-access platform enables non-technical audiences to engage with detailed emissions datasets for most subnational governments worldwide. Climate TRACE supports data-driven climate action at scales where decisions are made, representing a major breakthrough for emissions accounting and mitigation.",human
"Generation of dynamic, scalable multi-species bird soundscapes remains a significant challenge in computer music and algorithmic sound design. Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.",human
"The PC algorithm is a widely used method in causal inference for learning the structure of Bayesian networks. Despite its popularity, the PC algorithm suffers from significant time complexity, particularly as the size of the dataset increases, which limits its applicability in large-scale real-world problems. In this study, we propose a novel approach that utilises the Tsetlin Machine (TM) to construct Bayesian structures more efficiently. Our method leverages the most significant literals extracted from the TM and performs conditional independence (CI) tests on these selected literals instead of the full set of variables, resulting in a considerable reduction in computational time. We implemented our approach and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Our evaluation includes categorical datasets from the bnlearn repository, such as Munin1, Hepar2. The findings indicate that the proposed TM-based method not only reduces computational complexity but also maintains competitive accuracy in causal discovery, making it a viable alternative to traditional PC algorithm implementations by offering improved efficiency without compromising performance.",human
"We present Tiny-TSM, a time series foundation model characterized by small scale, economical training, and state-of-the-art performance. It comprises 23M total parameters, trained on a single A100 GPU in less than a week using a new synthetic data generation and data augmentation pipeline (SynthTS). Without any neural architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, or scaling up model size, Tiny-TSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of time series benchmark datasets, often outperforming much larger models and even matching the performance of much larger, industrial-scale, likely highly tuned foundation models. Specifically, Tiny-TSM outperforms all other time series foundation models we evaluated on medium- and long-term forecasting tasks under MSE loss, while short-term accuracy is still competitive with state-of-the-art models.   We also introduce a causal input normalization scheme that enables time series models to be trained with dense next-token prediction loss, significantly accelerating convergence speed and reducing training time.   All experiments were conducted on a single A100 GPU, illustrating the practicality of the proposed approach in a resource-constrained setting.",human
"Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising parallel generation paradigm but suffer from slow inference due to numerous refinement steps and the inability to use standard KV caching. We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/CDLM.",human
"While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.",human
"This work evaluates the effectiveness of spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for multi-store retail sales forecasting and compares their performance against ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost baselines. Using weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores, we construct a relational forecasting framework that models inter-store dependencies through a learned adaptive graph. The proposed STGNN predicts log-differenced sales and reconstructs final values through a residual path, enabling stable training and improved generalisation. Experiments show that STGNN achieves the lowest overall forecasting error, outperforming all baselines in Normalised Total Absolute Error, P90 MAPE, and variance of MAPE across stores. Analysis of the learned adjacency matrix reveals meaningful functional store clusters and high-influence nodes that emerge without geographic metadata. These results demonstrate that relational structure significantly improves forecast quality in interconnected retail environments and establishes STGNNs as a robust modelling choice for multi-store demand prediction.",human
"The black box nature of deep neural networks poses a significant challenge for the deployment of transparent and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems. With the growing presence of AI in society, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods that can explain and interpret the decisions made by these systems. To address this, mechanistic interpretability (MI) emerged as a promising and distinctive research program within the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). MI is the process of studying the inner computations of neural networks and translating them into human-understandable algorithms. It encompasses reverse engineering techniques aimed at uncovering the computational algorithms implemented by neural networks. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy of MI approaches and provide a detailed analysis of key techniques, illustrated with concrete examples and pseudo-code. We contextualize MI within the broader interpretability landscape, comparing its goals, methods, and insights to other strands of XAI. Additionally, we trace the development of MI as a research area, highlighting its conceptual roots and the accelerating pace of recent work. We argue that MI holds significant potential to support a more scientific understanding of machine learning systems -- treating models not only as tools for solving tasks, but also as systems to be studied and understood. We hope to invite new researchers into the field of mechanistic interpretability.",human
"Generative Flow Networks, or GFlowNets, offer a promising framework for molecular design, but their internal decision policies remain opaque. This limits adoption in drug discovery, where chemists require clear and interpretable rationales for proposed structures. We present an interpretability framework for SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet trained on documented chemical reactions and purchasable starting materials that generates both molecules and the synthetic routes that produce them. Our approach integrates three complementary components. Gradient based saliency combined with counterfactual perturbations identifies which atomic environments influence reward and how structural edits change molecular outcomes. Sparse autoencoders reveal axis aligned latent factors that correspond to physicochemical properties such as polarity, lipophilicity, and molecular size. Motif probes show that functional groups including aromatic rings and halogens are explicitly encoded and linearly decodable from the internal embeddings. Together, these results expose the chemical logic inside SynFlowNet and provide actionable and mechanistic insight that supports transparent and controllable molecular design.",human
"Perovskite solar cells are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction.",human
"We develop a moduli-theoretic view of psychometric test batteries for AI agents and connect it explicitly to the AAI score developed previously. First, we make precise the notion of an AAI functional on a battery and set out axioms that any reasonable autonomy/general intelligence score should satisfy. Second, we show that the composite index ('AAI-Index') defined previously is a special case of our AAI functional. Third, we introduce the notion of a cognitive core of an agent relative to a battery and define the associated AAI$_{\textrm{core}}$ score as the restriction of an AAI functional to that core. Finally, we use these notions to describe invariants of batteries under evaluation-preserving symmetries and outline how moduli of equivalent batteries are organized.",human
"Hunger and satiety dynamics shape dietary behaviors and metabolic health, yet remain difficult to capture in everyday settings. We present a Nutrition Photoplethysmography Language Model (NPLM), integrating continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) from wearables with meal descriptions. NPLM projects PPG into embeddings interpretable by language models, enabling joint reasoning over physiology and meal context. Trained on 19,340 participants and 1.1 million meal-PPG pairs, the model improved daily caloric intake prediction by 11% over text-only baselines, with accuracy maintained when 80% of meal text was removed. In an independent validation study (n=140) with controlled dining and detailed meal information, the model replicated these findings. These results demonstrate the value of integrating physiological measurements from consumer wearables with meal information for noninvasive dietary monitoring at scale.",human
"With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications. The code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MMed-RAG-Attack-F05A.",human
"Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.   To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.",human
"Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes.",human
"Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training.",human
"Open weight models, which are ubiquitous, rarely provide access to their training data or loss function. This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning constrained by this unavailability an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. ModHiFi-U, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers.",human
"In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.   This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.",human
"Searching large and complex design spaces for a global optimum can be infeasible and unnecessary. A practical alternative is to iteratively refine the neighborhood of an initial design using local optimization methods such as gradient descent. We propose local entropy search (LES), a Bayesian optimization paradigm that explicitly targets the solutions reachable by the descent sequences of iterative optimizers. The algorithm propagates the posterior belief over the objective through the optimizer, resulting in a probability distribution over descent sequences. It then selects the next evaluation by maximizing mutual information with that distribution, using a combination of analytic entropy calculations and Monte-Carlo sampling of descent sequences. Empirical results on high-complexity synthetic objectives and benchmark problems show that LES achieves strong sample efficiency compared to existing local and global Bayesian optimization methods.",human
"Many real-world bandit problems involve non-stationary reward distributions, where the optimal decision may shift due to evolving environments. However, the performance of some typical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) models such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms degrades significantly in non-stationary environments where reward distributions change over time. To address this limitation, this paper introduces and evaluates FDSW-UCB, a novel dual-view algorithm that integrates a discount-based long-term perspective with a sliding-window-based short-term view. A data-driven semi-synthetic simulation platform, built upon the MovieLens-1M and Open Bandit datasets, is developed to test algorithm adaptability under abrupt and gradual drift scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that a well-configured sliding-window mechanism (SW-UCB) is robust, while the widely used discounting method (D-UCB) suffers from a fundamental learning failure, leading to linear regret. Crucially, the proposed FDSW-UCB, when employing an optimistic aggregation strategy, achieves superior performance in dynamic settings, highlighting that the ensemble strategy itself is a decisive factor for success.",human
"In answer set programming, two groups of rules are considered strongly equivalent if they have the same meaning in any context.

"Existing humanoid control systems often rely on teleoperation or modular generation pipelines that separate language understanding from physical execution. However, the former is entirely human-driven, and the latter lacks tight alignment between language commands and physical behaviors. In this paper, we present SENTINEL, a fully end-to-end language-action model for humanoid whole-body control. We construct a large-scale dataset by tracking human motions in simulation using a pretrained whole body controller, combined with their text annotations. The model directly maps language commands and proprioceptive inputs to low-level actions without any intermediate representation. The model generates action chunks using flow matching, which can be subsequently refined by a residual action head for real-world deployment. Our method exhibits strong semantic understanding and stable execution on humanoid robots in both simulation and real-world deployment, and also supports multi-modal extensions by converting inputs into texts.",human
"How and where does a transformer notice that a sentence has gone semantically off the rails? To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.",human
"Diffusion Transformer(DiT) based video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual quality and temporal coherence, but they still frequently violate basic physical laws and commonsense dynamics, revealing a lack of explicit world knowledge. In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity. Our code and data are publicly released here: https://thrcle421.github.io/DiT-Mem-Web/.",human
"Emergent communication in multi-agent systems typically occurs through independent learning, resulting in slow convergence and potentially suboptimal protocols. We introduce TSLEC (Trust-Based Social Learning with Emergent Communication), a framework where agents explicitly teach successful strategies to peers, with knowledge transfer modulated by learned trust relationships. Through experiments with 100 episodes across 30 random seeds, we demonstrate that trust-based social learning reduces episodes-to-convergence by 23.9% (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.98) compared to independent emergence, while producing compositional protocols (C = 0.38) that remain robust under dynamic objectives (Phi > 0.867 decoding accuracy). Trust scores strongly correlate with teaching quality (r = 0.743, p < 0.001), enabling effective knowledge filtering. Our results establish that explicit social learning fundamentally accelerates emergent communication in multi-agent coordination.",human
"Merging models fine-tuned for different tasks into a single unified model has become an increasingly important direction for building versatile, efficient multi-task systems. Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight the practical and theoretical value of our approach to model merging.",human
"Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in web services, delivering unprecedented capabilities while amplifying societal risks. Existing works tend to focus on either isolated jailbreak attacks or static defenses, neglecting the dynamic interplay between evolving threats and safeguards in real-world web contexts. To mitigate these challenges, we propose ACE-Safety (Adversarial Co-Evolution for LLM Safety), a novel framework that jointly optimize attack and defense models by seamlessly integrating two key innovative procedures: (1) Group-aware Strategy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (GS-MCTS), which efficiently explores jailbreak strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and generate diverse adversarial samples; (2) Adversarial Curriculum Tree-aware Group Policy Optimization (AC-TGPO), which jointly trains attack and defense LLMs with challenging samples via curriculum reinforcement learning, enabling robust mutual improvement. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attack and defense approaches, and provides a feasible pathway for developing LLMs that can sustainably support responsible AI ecosystems.",human
"Contradictory multimodal inputs are common in real-world settings, yet existing benchmarks typically assume input consistency and fail to evaluate cross-modal contradiction detection - a fundamental capability for preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliability. We introduce CLASH, a novel benchmark for multimodal contradiction detection, featuring COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing controlled object-level or attribute-level contradictions. The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. The benchmark provides an extensive fine-tuning set filtered through automated quality checks, alongside a smaller human-verified diagnostic set. Our analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals substantial limitations in recognizing cross-modal conflicts, exposing systematic modality biases and category-specific weaknesses. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning on CLASH substantially enhances conflict detection capabilities.",human
"This paper introduces Paraconsistent-Lib, an open-source, easy-to-use Python library for building PAL2v algorithms in reasoning and decision-making systems. Paraconsistent-Lib is designed as a general-purpose library of PAL2v standard calculations, presenting three types of results: paraconsistent analysis in one of the 12 classical lattice PAL2v regions, paraconsistent analysis node (PAN) outputs, and a decision output. With Paraconsistent-Lib, well-known PAL2v algorithms such as Para-analyzer, ParaExtrCTX, PAL2v Filter, paraconsistent analysis network (PANnet), and paraconsistent neural network (PNN) can be written in stand-alone or network form, reducing complexity, code size, and bugs, as two examples presented in this paper.

"Detecting deepfake images is crucial in combating misinformation. We present a lightweight, generalizable binary classification model based on EfficientNet-B6, fine-tuned with transformation techniques to address severe class imbalances. By leveraging robust preprocessing, oversampling, and optimization strategies, our model achieves high accuracy, stability, and generalization. While incorporating Fourier transform-based phase and amplitude features showed minimal impact, our proposed framework helps non-experts to effectively identify deepfake images, making significant strides toward accessible and reliable deepfake detection.",human
"Designing new protein structures is fundamental to computational biology, enabling advances in therapeutic molecule discovery and enzyme engineering. Existing diffusion-based generative models typically operate in Cartesian coordinate space, where adding noise disrupts strict geometric constraints such as fixed bond lengths and angles, often producing physically invalid structures. To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward full-atom protein generation.",human
"Text-to-image diffusion models can emit copyrighted, unsafe, or private content. Safety alignment aims to suppress specific concepts, yet evaluations seldom test whether safety persists under benign downstream fine-tuning routinely applied after deployment (e.g., LoRA personalization, style/domain adapters). We study the stability of current safety methods under benign fine-tuning and observe frequent breakdowns. As true safety alignment must withstand even benign post-deployment adaptations, we introduce the SPQR benchmark (Safety-Prompt adherence-Quality-Robustness). SPQR is a single-scored metric that provides a standardized and reproducible framework to evaluate how well safety-aligned diffusion models preserve safety, utility, and robustness under benign fine-tuning, by reporting a single leaderboard score to facilitate comparisons. We conduct multilingual, domain-specific, and out-of-distribution analyses, along with category-wise breakdowns, to identify when safety alignment fails after benign fine-tuning, ultimately showcasing SPQR as a concise yet comprehensive benchmark for T2I safety alignment techniques for T2I models.",human
"Recipe recommendation has become an essential task in web-based food platforms. A central challenge is effectively leveraging rich multimodal features beyond user-recipe interactions. Our analysis shows that even simple uses of multimodal signals yield competitive performance, suggesting that systematic enhancement of these signals is highly promising. We propose TESMR, a 3-stage framework for recipe recommendation that progressively refines raw multimodal features into effective embeddings through: (1) content-based enhancement using foundation models with multimodal comprehension, (2) relation-based enhancement via message propagation over user-recipe interactions, and (3) learning-based enhancement through contrastive learning with learnable embeddings. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that TESMR outperforms existing methods, achieving 7-15% higher Recall@10.",human
"A critical barrier to the trustworthiness of sixth-generation (6G) agentic autonomous networks is the uncertainty neglect bias; a cognitive tendency for large language model (LLM)-powered agents to make high-stakes decisions based on simple averages while ignoring the tail risk of extreme events. This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach. This work provides a concrete methodology for building the trustworthy autonomous systems required for 6G.",human
"Advertising (Ad) is a cornerstone of the digital economy, yet the moderation of video advertisements remains a significant challenge due to their complexity and the need for precise violation localization. While recent advancements, such as the RAVEN model, have improved coarse-grained violation detection, critical gaps persist in fine-grained understanding, explainability, and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose RAVEN++, a novel framework that introduces three key innovations: 1) Active Reinforcement Learning (RL), which dynamically adapts training to samples of varying difficulty; 2) Fine-Grained Violation Understanding, achieved through hierarchical reward functions and reasoning distillation; and 3) Progressive Multi-Stage Training, which systematically combines knowledge injection, curriculum-based passive RL, and active RL. Extensive experiments on both public and proprietary datasets, on both offline scenarios and online deployed A/B Testing, demonstrate that RAVEN++ outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized models like RAVEN in terms of fine-grained violation understanding, reasoning capabilities, and generalization ability.",human
"Timely and accurate assessment of damages following natural disasters is essential for effective emergency response and recovery. Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency. Experiments on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA, UAV-based datasets from flood- and hurricane-affected regions, demonstrate that ThiFAN-VQA achieves superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for real-world post-disaster damage assessment tasks.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as ""What treats asthma?"" or ""What is the capital of Latvia?"". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone.",human
"We propose a refinement of temporal-difference learning that enforces first-order Bellman consistency: the learned value function is trained to match not only the Bellman targets in value but also their derivatives with respect to states and actions. By differentiating the Bellman backup through differentiable dynamics, we obtain analytically consistent gradient targets. Incorporating these into the critic objective using a Sobolev-type loss encourages the critic to align with both the value and local geometry of the target function. This first-order TD matching principle can be seamlessly integrated into existing algorithms, such as Q-learning or actor-critic methods (e.g., DDPG, SAC), potentially leading to faster critic convergence and more stable policy gradients without altering their overall structure.",human
"This paper introduces a novel Kalman filter framework designed to achieve robust state estimation under both process and measurement noise. Inspired by the Weighted Observation Likelihood Filter (WoLF), which provides robustness against measurement outliers, we applied generalized Bayesian approach to build a framework considering both process and measurement noise outliers.",human
"The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This ""Energy-Time-Space"" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.",human
"Sleep stage classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamental for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders. However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.",human
"The processing of high-dimensional streaming data commonly utilizes online streaming feature selection (OSFS) techniques. However, practical implementations often face challenges with data incompleteness due to equipment failures and technical constraints. Online Sparse Streaming Feature Selection (OS2FS) tackles this issue through latent factor analysis-based missing data imputation. Despite this advancement, existing OS2FS approaches exhibit substantial limitations in feature evaluation, resulting in performance deterioration. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel Online Differential Evolution for Sparse Feature Selection (ODESFS) in data streams, incorporating two key innovations: (1) missing value imputation using a latent factor analysis model, and (2) feature importance evaluation through differential evolution. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that ODESFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art OSFS and OS2FS methods by selecting optimal feature subsets and achieving superior accuracy.",human
"Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for generative modeling over discrete domains. It is known that MDMs effectively train to decode tokens in a random order, and that this ordering has significant performance implications in practice. This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders.",human
"In finance, predictive models must balance accuracy and interpretability, particularly in credit risk assessment, where model decisions carry material consequences. We present a quantum neural network (QNN) based on a single qudit, in which both data features and trainable parameters are co-encoded within a unified unitary evolution generated by the full Lie algebra. This design explores the entire Hilbert space while enabling interpretability through the magnitudes of the learned coefficients. We benchmark our model on a real-world, imbalanced credit-risk dataset from Taiwan. The proposed QNN consistently outperforms LR and reaches the results of random forest models in macro-F1 score while preserving a transparent correspondence between learned parameters and input feature importance. To quantify the interpretability of the proposed model, we introduce two complementary metrics: (i) the edit distance between the model's feature ranking and that of LR, and (ii) a feature-poisoning test where selected features are replaced with noise. Results indicate that the proposed quantum model achieves competitive performance while offering a tractable path toward interpretable quantum learning.",human
"This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.",human
"Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants.",human
"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle com- plex multi-step tasks. While base LLMs, pre-trained on general text corpora, often struggle with reasoning due to a lack of specialized training, recent studies reveal their latent reason- ing potential tied to hidden states. However, existing hidden state manipulation methods, such as linear activation steering, suffer from limitations due to their rigid and unconstrained nature, often leading to distribution shifts and degraded text quality. In this work, we propose a novel approach for elic- iting CoT reasoning from base LLMs through hidden state manipulation grounded in probabilistic conditional generation. By reformulating the challenge as an optimization problem with a balanced likelihood and prior regularization framework, our method guides hidden states toward reasoning-oriented trajectories while preserving linguistic coherence. Extensive evaluations across mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach con- sistently outperforms existing steering methods, offering a theoretically principled and effective solution for enhancing reasoning capabilities in base LLMs.",human
"Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction coupled with uncertainty quantification remains a critical challenge in aerospace prognostics. This research introduces a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that learns aleatoric uncertainty directly through probabilistic modeling, an approach unexplored in existing CMAPSS-based literature. Our hierarchical architecture integrates multi-scale Inception blocks for temporal pattern extraction, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequential modeling, and a dual-level attention mechanism operating simultaneously on sensor and temporal dimensions. The innovation lies in the Bayesian output layer that predicts both mean RUL and variance, enabling the model to learn data-inherent uncertainty. Comprehensive preprocessing employs condition-aware clustering, wavelet denoising, and intelligent feature selection. Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks (FD001-FD004) demonstrates competitive overall performance with RMSE values of 16.22, 19.29, 16.84, and 19.98 respectively. Remarkably, our framework achieves breakthrough critical zone performance (RUL <= 30 cycles) with RMSE of 5.14, 6.89, 5.27, and 7.16, representing 25-40 percent improvements over conventional approaches and establishing new benchmarks for safety-critical predictions. The learned uncertainty provides well-calibrated 95 percent confidence intervals with coverage ranging from 93.5 percent to 95.2 percent, enabling risk-aware maintenance scheduling previously unattainable in CMAPSS literature.",human
"Aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) has achieved remarkable progress with large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches primarily emphasize sentiment polarity while overlooking the underlying emotional dimensions that shape sentiment expressions. This limitation hinders the model's ability to capture fine-grained affective signals toward specific aspect categories. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel emotion-enhanced multi-task ACSA framework that jointly learns sentiment polarity and category-specific emotions grounded in Ekman's six basic emotions. Leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, our approach enables the model to produce emotional descriptions for each aspect category, thereby enriching sentiment representations with affective expressions. Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the generated emotions, we introduce an emotion refinement mechanism based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensional framework. Specifically, emotions predicted by the LLM are projected onto a VAD space, and those inconsistent with their corresponding VAD coordinates are re-annotated using a structured LLM-based refinement strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on all benchmark datasets. This underlines the effectiveness of integrating affective dimensions into ACSA.",human
"The structure of naming systems in natural languages hinges on a trade-off between high informativeness and low complexity. Prior work capitalizes on information theory to formalize these notions; however, these studies generally rely on two simplifications: (i) optimal listeners, and (ii) universal communicative need across languages. Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker. Adopting a referential game setup from emergent communication, and focusing on the semantic domain of kinship, we show that our notion of optimality is not only theoretically achievable but also emerges empirically in learned communication systems.",human
"In this paper, we describe a symbolic model for the automatic orthographic unification of Nawatl text documents. Our model is based on algorithms that we have previously used to analyze sentences in Nawatl, and on the corpus called $π$-yalli, consisting of texts in several Nawatl orthographies. Our automatic unification algorithm implements linguistic rules in symbolic regular expressions. We also present a manual evaluation protocol that we have proposed and implemented to assess the quality of the unified sentences generated by our algorithm, by testing in a sentence semantic task. We have obtained encouraging results from the evaluators for most of the desired features of our artificially unified sentences",human
"In AI, the existential risk denotes the hypothetical threat posed by an artificial system that would possess both the capability and the objective, either directly or indirectly, to eradicate humanity. This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues.",human
"As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.",human
"We study core stability in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective, where each agent's loss is the maximum distance to other members of their cluster. We prove that for all $k\geq 3$ there exist metric instances with $n\ge 9$ agents, with $n$ divisible by $k$, for which no clustering lies in the $α$-core for any $α<2^{\frac{1}{5}}\sim 1.148$. The bound is tight for our construction. Using a computer-aided proof, we also identify a two-dimensional Euclidean point set whose associated lower bound is slightly smaller than that of our general construction. This is, to our knowledge, the first impossibility result showing that the core can be empty in non-centroid clustering under the max-loss objective.",human
"The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an enormous amount of sensor data that requires transmission to cloud servers for processing, resulting in excessive network congestion, increased latency and high energy consumption. This is particularly problematic in resource-constrained and remote environments where bandwidth is limited, and battery-dependent devices further emphasize the problem. Moreover, in domains such as agriculture, consecutive sensor readings often have minimal variation, making continuous data transmission inefficient and unnecessarily resource intensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical prediction algorithm designed for edge computing environments and validated through simulation. The proposed solution utilizes a predictive filter at the network edge that forecasts the next sensor data point and triggers data transmission only when the deviation from the predicted value exceeds a predefined tolerance. A complementary cloud-based model ensures data integrity and overall system consistency. This dual-model strategy effectively reduces communication overhead and demonstrates potential for improving energy efficiency by minimizing redundant transmissions. In addition to reducing communication load, our approach leverages both in situ and satellite observations from the same locations to enhance model robustness. It also supports cross-site generalization, enabling models trained in one region to be effectively deployed elsewhere without retraining. This makes our solution highly scalable, energy-aware, and well-suited for optimizing sensor data transmission in remote and bandwidth-constrained IoT environments.",human
"Automata extraction is a method for synthesising interpretable surrogates for black-box neural models that can be analysed symbolically. Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network.",human
"The advent of financial technology has witnessed a surge in the utilization of deep learning models to anticipate consumer conduct, a trend that has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing lending strategies and bolstering market efficiency. We study multi-horizon demand forecasting on e-commerce transactions using the UCI Online Retail II dataset. Unlike prior versions of this manuscript that mixed financial-loan narratives with retail data, we focus exclusively on retail market behavior and define a clear prediction target: per SKU daily demand (or revenue) for horizons H=1,7,14. We present a hybrid sequence model that combines multi-scale temporal convolutions, a gated recurrent module, and time-aware self-attention. The model is trained with standard regression losses and evaluated under MAE, RMSE, sMAPE, MASE, and Theil's U_2 with strict time-based splits to prevent leakage. We benchmark against ARIMA/Prophet, LSTM/GRU, LightGBM, and state-of-the-art Transformer forecasters (TFT, Informer, Autoformer, N-BEATS). Results show consistent accuracy gains and improved robustness on peak/holiday periods. We further provide ablations and statistical significance tests to ensure the reliability of improvements, and we release implementation details to facilitate reproducibility.",human
"Flow-based generative models synthesize data by integrating a learned velocity field from a reference distribution to the target data distribution. Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics.",human
"In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for named entity recognition (NER) in low-resource scenarios. However, existing ICL-based NER methods suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, which is problematic when annotated data is scarce; (2) limited generalization to unseen domains due to the LLM's insufficient internal domain knowledge; and (3) failure to incorporate external knowledge or resolve entity ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose KDR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for multi-domain low-resource in-context NER that integrates Knowledge retrieval, Disambiguation, and Reflective analysis. KDR-Agent leverages natural-language type definitions and a static set of entity-level contrastive demonstrations to reduce dependency on large annotated corpora. A central planner coordinates specialized agents to (i) retrieve factual knowledge from Wikipedia for domain-specific mentions, (ii) resolve ambiguous entities via contextualized reasoning, and (iii) reflect on and correct model predictions through structured self-assessment. Experiments across ten datasets from five domains demonstrate that KDR-Agent significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot ICL baselines across multiple LLM backbones.

"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.",human
"Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) provides a flexible way to match or compare nonnegative finite Radon measures. However, UOT requires a predefined ground transport cost, which may misrepresent the data's underlying geometry. Choosing such a cost is particularly challenging when datasets live in heterogeneous spaces, often motivating practitioners to adopt Gromov-Wasserstein formulations. To address this challenge, we introduce cost-regularized unbalanced optimal transport (CR-UOT), a framework that allows the ground cost to vary while allowing mass creation and removal. We show that CR-UOT incorporates unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems through families of inner-product costs parameterized by linear transformations, enabling the matching of measures or point clouds across Euclidean spaces. We develop algorithms for such CR-UOT problems using entropic regularization and demonstrate that this approach improves the alignment of heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles, especially when many cells lack direct matches.",human
"This paper proposes a novel semiotic framework for analyzing Large Language Models (LLMs), conceptualizing them as stochastic semiotic engines whose outputs demand active, asymmetric human interpretation. We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools. Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations. We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda. The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $λ$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda. This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability. We demonstrate the framework's utility across four key applications: (i) model profiling; (ii) optimizing prompt/context design; (iii) risk analysis based on ambiguity; and (iv) adaptive semiotic systems. We conclude that this capacity-based semiotic approach offers a rigorous, actionable toolkit for understanding, evaluating, and designing LLM-mediated communication.",human
"Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.",human
"In Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL), the central server immediately updates the global model with each arriving client's contribution. As a result, clients perform their local training on different model versions, causing information staleness (delay). In federated environments with non-IID local data distributions, this asynchronous pattern amplifies the adverse effect of client heterogeneity (due to different data distribution, local objectives, etc.), as faster clients contribute more frequent updates, biasing the global model. We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients. We also introduce a delay-aware variant, ACED, to balance client diversity against update staleness. Experiments on different models for different tasks across diverse heterogeneity and delay settings validate our analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of our approaches.",human
"MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.",human

"In expressing emotions, as an expression form separate from natural language, we propose an alternative form that complements natural language, acting as a proxy or window for emotional states. First, we set up an expression form ""Effect of Contradictory Structure."" ""Effect of Contradictory Structure"" is not static but dynamic. Effect in ""Effect of Contradictory Structure"" is unpleasant or pleasant, and the orientation to avoid that unpleasantness is considered pseudo-expression of will. Second, ""Effect of Contradictory Structure"" can be overlapped with each other. This overlapping operation is called ""montage."" A broader ""Structure"" that includes related ""Effect of Contradictory Structure"" and ""Effect of Structure"" are set up. Montage produces ""Effect of Structure"". In montage, it is necessary to set something like ""strength,"" so we adopted Deleuze and Deleuze/Guattari's word ""intensity"" and set it as an element of our model. We set up a general theoretical framework - Word Import Between Systems (Models) and justified the import of ""intensity"" through Austin's use of the word ""force."" ""Effect of Structure"" process is demonstrated using the example of proceeding to the next level of education.",human
"The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.",human
"Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, ""brain-based"" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies ""true"" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.",human
"Medical image segmentation is fundamental for biomedical discovery. Existing methods lack generalizability and demand extensive, time-consuming manual annotation for new clinical application. Here, we propose MedSAM-3, a text promptable medical segmentation model for medical image and video segmentation. By fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 architecture on medical images paired with semantic conceptual labels, our MedSAM-3 enables medical Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS), allowing precise targeting of anatomical structures via open-vocabulary text descriptions rather than solely geometric prompts. We further introduce the MedSAM-3 Agent, a framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning and iterative refinement in an agent-in-the-loop workflow. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, CT, and video, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing specialist and foundation models. We will release our code and model at https://github.com/Joey-S-Liu/MedSAM3.",human
"Message passing graph neural networks are widely used for learning on graphs, yet their expressive power is limited by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test and can fail to distinguish structurally different nodes. We provide rigorous theory for a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and to basis rotations within eigenspaces. We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size. As an instantiation, pairing this encoding with a neural-process style decoder yields significant gains on a drug-drug interaction task on chemical graphs, improving both the area under the ROC curve and the F1 score and demonstrating the practical benefits of resolving theoretical expressiveness limitations with principled positional information.",human
"Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.",human
"Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and optimizing visual experience. Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.",human
"Preference learning has recently emerged as a pivotal strategy for post-training alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data.",human
"Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWN) are rapidly expanding with the growing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for logistics, surveillance, and emergency response. Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction.",human
"Large language models demonstrate powerful capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet they also harbor safety vulnerabilities. To enhance LLM safety, various jailbreak defense methods have been proposed to guard against harmful outputs. However, improvements in model safety often come at the cost of severe over-refusal, failing to strike a good balance between safety and usability. In this paper, we first analyze the causes of over-refusal from a representation perspective, revealing that over-refusal samples reside at the boundary between benign and malicious samples. Based on this, we propose MOSR, designed to mitigate over-refusal by intervening the safety representation of LLMs. MOSR incorporates two novel components: (1) Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting, which determines the erasure weight for malicious samples by quantifying their similarity to pseudo-malicious samples in the representation space, and (2) Context-Aware Augmentation, which supplements the necessary context for rejection decisions by adding harmful prefixes before rejection responses. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in mitigating over-refusal while largely maintaining safety. Overall, we advocate that future defense methods should strike a better balance between safety and over-refusal.",human
"Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) consists of two sub-tasks: intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF). Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU.",human
"The current KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope, still under construction, has not yet reached its full potential in neutrino reconstruction capability. When training any deep learning model, no explicit information about the physics or the detector is provided, thus they remain unknown to the model.

The study also shows the efficacy of transformers on retaining valuable information between detectors when doing fine-tuning from one configurations to another.",human

"The mixture model is undoubtedly one of the greatest contributions to clustering. For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM. We demonstrate the interest of such approach in terms of clustering and data embedding. We also establish different connections with other clustering approaches.",human
"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in plant disease classification using leaf images. Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.",human
"The challenge of building neural networks that can continuously learn and adapt to evolving data streams is central to the fields of continual learning (CL) and reinforcement learning (RL). This lifelong learning problem is often framed in terms of the plasticity-stability dilemma, focusing on issues like loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting. Unlike neural networks, biological brains maintain plasticity through capacity growth, inspiring researchers to explore similar approaches in artificial networks, such as adding capacity dynamically. Prior solutions often lack parameter efficiency or depend on explicit task indices, but Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer a promising alternative by specializing experts for distinct distributions. This paper aims to evaluate a DynamicMoE approach for continual and reinforcement learning environments and benchmark its effectiveness against existing network expansion methods.",human
"Foundation models (FM) are transforming artificial intelligence by enabling generalizable, data-efficient solutions across different domains for a broad range of applications. However, the lack of large and diverse datasets limits the development of FM in nanophotonics. This work presents MOCLIP (Metasurface Optics Contrastive Learning Pretrained), a nanophotonic foundation model that integrates metasurface geometry and spectra within a shared latent space. MOCLIP employs contrastive learning to align geometry and spectral representations using an experimentally acquired dataset with a sample density comparable to ImageNet-1K. The study demonstrates MOCLIP inverse design capabilities for high-throughput zero-shot prediction at a rate of 0.2 million samples per second, enabling the design of a full 4-inch wafer populated with high-density metasurfaces in minutes. It also shows generative latent-space optimization reaching 97 percent accuracy. Finally, we introduce an optical information storage concept that uses MOCLIP to achieve a density of 0.1 Gbit per square millimeter at the resolution limit, exceeding commercial optical media by a factor of six. These results position MOCLIP as a scalable and versatile platform for next-generation photonic design and data-driven applications.",human
"Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge. While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.",human
"This thesis presents methods and datasets to investigate cartographic heritage on a large scale and from a cultural perspective. Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems. Analyses of collaboration and diffusion highlight the role of legitimacy, larger actors, and major cities in the spread of figurative norms and semiotic cultures.",human
"The security of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is a significant concern, as studies indicate that such code often contains vulnerabilities and lacks essential defensive programming constructs. This work focuses on examining and evaluating the security of LLM-generated code, particularly in the context of C/C++. We categorized known vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and, to study their criticality, mapped them to CVEs. We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning. Our findings highlight the need for developers to be cautious when using LLM-generated code. This study provides valuable insights to advance automated code generation and encourage further research in this domain.",human
"Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.",human
"The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems poses challenges for power grid management, as many installations remain undocumented. While satellite imagery provides global coverage, traditional computer vision (CV) models such as CNNs and U-Nets require extensive labeled data and fail to generalize across regions. This study investigates the cross-domain generalization of a multimodal large language model (LLM) for global PV assessment. By leveraging structured prompts and fine-tuning, the model integrates detection, localization, and quantification within a unified schema. Cross-regional evaluation using the $Δ$F1 metric demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the smallest performance degradation across unseen regions, outperforming conventional CV and transformer baselines. These results highlight the robustness of multimodal LLMs under domain shift and their potential for scalable, transferable, and interpretable global PV mapping.",human
"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.",human
"As graph-structured data grow increasingly large, evaluating their robustness under adversarial attacks becomes computationally expensive and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to compress graphs into compact representations that preserve both topological structure and robustness profile, enabling efficient and reliable evaluation. We propose Cutter, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework composed of a Vital Detection Agent (VDA) and a Redundancy Detection Agent (RDA), which collaboratively identify structurally vital and redundant nodes for guided compression. Cutter incorporates three key strategies to enhance learning efficiency and compression quality: trajectory-level reward shaping to transform sparse trajectory returns into dense, policy-equivalent learning signals; prototype-based shaping to guide decisions using behavioral patterns from both high- and low-return trajectories; and cross-agent imitation to enable safer and more transferable exploration. Experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that Cutter generates compressed graphs that retain essential static topological properties and exhibit robustness degradation trends highly consistent with the original graphs under various attack scenarios, thereby significantly improving evaluation efficiency without compromising assessment fidelity.",human
"Inference attacks have been widely studied and offer a systematic risk assessment of ML services; however, their implementation and the attack parameters for optimal estimation are challenging for non-experts. The emergence of advanced large language models presents a promising yet largely unexplored opportunity to develop autonomous agents as inference attack experts, helping address this challenge. In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise.",human
"Automated decision-making under uncertainty requires balancing exploitation and exploration. Classical methods treat these separately using heuristics, while Active Inference unifies them through Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization. However, EFE minimization is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. We build on recent theory recasting EFE minimization as variational inference, formally unifying it with Planning-as-Inference and showing the epistemic drive as a unique entropic contribution. Our main contribution is a novel message-passing scheme for this unified objective, enabling scalable Active Inference in factored-state MDPs and overcoming high-dimensional planning intractability.",human
"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in Embodied AI. However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.",human
"Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.",human
"We propose a fully data-driven approach to designing mutual information (MI) estimators. Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines. Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions.",human
"Accurate diagnosis of spitzoid tumors (ST) is critical to ensure a favorable prognosis and to avoid both under- and over-treatment. Epigenetic data, particularly DNA methylation, provide a valuable source of information for this task. However, prior studies assume complete data, an unrealistic setting as methylation profiles frequently contain missing entries due to limited coverage and experimental artifacts. Our work challenges these favorable scenarios and introduces ReMAC, an extension of ReMasker designed to tackle classification tasks on high-dimensional data under complete and incomplete regimes. Evaluation on real clinical data demonstrates that ReMAC achieves strong and robust performance compared to competing classification methods in the stratification of ST. Code is available: https://github.com/roshni-mahtani/ReMAC.",human
"Cross-subject motor-imagery decoding remains a major challenge in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces due to strong subject variability and the curved geometry of covariance matrices on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. We address the zero-shot cross-subject setting, where no target-subject labels or adaptation are allowed, by introducing novel geometry-aware preprocessing modules and deep congruence networks that operate directly on SPD covariance matrices. Our preprocessing modules, DCR and RiFU, extend Riemannian Alignment by improving action separation while reducing subject-specific distortions. We further propose two manifold classifiers, SPD-DCNet and RiFUNet, which use hierarchical congruence transforms to learn discriminative, subject-invariant covariance representations. On the BCI-IV 2a benchmark, our framework improves cross-subject accuracy by 3-4% over the strongest classical baselines, demonstrating the value of geometry-aware transformations for robust EEG decoding.",human
"We present a graphical, knowledge-based method for reviewing treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials. The approach enhances MedDRA by adding a hidden medical knowledge layer (Safeterm) that captures semantic relationships between terms in a 2-D map. Using this layer, AE Preferred Terms can be regrouped automatically into similarity clusters, and their association to the trial disease may be quantified. The Safeterm map is available online and connected to aggregated AE incidence tables from ClinicalTrials.gov. For signal detection, we compute treatment-specific disproportionality metrics using shrinkage incidence ratios. Cluster-level EBGM values are then derived through precision-weighted aggregation. Two visual outputs support interpretation: a semantic map showing AE incidence and an expectedness-versus-disproportionality plot for rapid signal detection. Applied to three legacy trials, the automated method clearly recovers all expected safety signals. Overall, augmenting MedDRA with a medical knowledge layer improves clarity, efficiency, and accuracy in AE interpretation for clinical trials.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant bottleneck during autoregressive inference due to the massive memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.",human
"The task of translating natural language questions into query languages has long been a central focus in semantic parsing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in this field. However, existing studies typically focus on a single query language, resulting in methods with limited generalizability across different languages. In this paper, we formally define the Text-to-Query task paradigm, unifying semantic parsing tasks across various query languages. We identify query skeletons as a shared optimization target of Text-to-Query tasks, and propose a general dynamic data augmentation framework that explicitly diagnoses model-specific weaknesses in handling these skeletons to synthesize targeted training data. Experiments on four Text-to-Query benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a small amount of synthesized data, highlighting the efficiency and generality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for unified research on Text-to-Query tasks. We release our code at https://github.com/jjjycaptain/Skeletron.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

"Modern large language models integrate web search to provide real-time answers, yet it remains unclear whether they are efficiently calibrated to use search when it is actually needed. We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform. Taken together, internal web search works better as a good low-latency verification layer than a reliable analytical tool, with clear room for improvement.",human
"The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a lightweight architecture for learning solution operators for parametric PDEs by directly approximating the kernel integral using a Monte Carlo approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators, MCNO makes no spectral or translation-invariance assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over a fixed set of randomly sampled points. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with low computational cost, providing a simple and practical alternative to spectral and graph-based neural operators.",human
"With the rapid development of Large Language Models, dialogue systems are shifting from information tools to emotional companions, heralding the era of Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems (ECDs) that provide personalized emotional support for users. However, the field lacks clear definitions and systematic evaluation standards for ECDs. To address this, we first propose a definition of ECDs with formal descriptions. Then, based on this theory and the design principle of ""Ability Layer-Task Layer (three level)-Data Layer-Method Layer"", we design and implement the first ECD evaluation benchmark - MoodBench 1.0. Through extensive evaluations of 30 mainstream models, we demonstrate that MoodBench 1.0 has excellent discriminant validity and can effectively quantify the differences in emotional companionship abilities among models. Furthermore, the results reveal current models' shortcomings in deep emotional companionship, guiding future technological optimization and significantly aiding developers in enhancing ECDs' user experience.",human
"Linux kernel evolution breaks drivers through API/ABI changes, semantic shifts, and security-hardening updates. We introduce DRIVEBENCH, an executable corpus of kernel$\rightarrow$driver co-evolution cases, and AUTODRIVER, a closed-loop, LLM-driven system for automating driver maintenance. The system integrates prompt engineering, multi-agent collaboration, static analysis, and iterative validation to ensure that generated patches are not only syntactically correct but also functionally and semantically consistent with kernel conventions. The corpus spans v5.10-v6.10 with 235 validated cases drawn from 612 candidates. In evaluation across 55 cases, AUTODRIVER achieves 56.4% compilation success; QEMU-based boot verification indicates that compiled patches preserve driver initialization in most instances. By releasing DRIVEBENCH and tooling, we enable reproducible research and a practical route to continuous, safe co-evolution of drivers with the Linux kernel.",human
"Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an effective and lightweight framework for post-training visual generative models. However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.",human
"Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation. A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.",human
"Group-based policy optimization methods like GRPO and GSPO have become standard for training multimodal models, leveraging group-wise rollouts and relative advantage estimation. However, they suffer from a critical \emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VADE}, a \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead. More importantly, our framework can serves as a plug-and-play component to be seamlessly integrated into existing group-based RL algorithms. Code and models are available at https://VADE-RL.github.io.",human
"Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",human
"In this reproducibility study, we revisit the LLAMBO framework of Daxberger et al. (2024), a prompting-based Bayesian optimization (BO) method that uses large language models as discriminative surrogates and acquisition optimizers via text-only interactions. We replicate the core Bayesmark and HPOBench experiments under the original evaluation protocol, but replace GPT-3.5 with the open-weight Llama 3.1 70B model used for all text encoding components.   Our results broadly confirm the main claims of LLAMBO. Contextual warm starting via textual problem and hyperparameter descriptions substantially improves early regret behaviour and reduces variance across runs. LLAMBO's discriminative surrogate is weaker than GP or SMAC as a pure single task regressor, yet benefits from cross task semantic priors induced by the language model. Ablations that remove textual context markedly degrade predictive accuracy and calibration, while the LLAMBO candidate sampler consistently generates higher quality and more diverse proposals than TPE or random sampling. Experiments with smaller backbones (Gemma 27B, Llama 3.1 8B) yield unstable or invalid predictions, suggesting insufficient capacity for reliable surrogate behaviour.   Overall, our study shows that the LLAMBO architecture is robust to changing the language model backbone and remains effective when instantiated with Llama 3.1 70B.",human
"Efficient deployment of small language models (SLMs) is essential for numerous real-world applications with stringent latency constraints. While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively.",human
"Data contamination poses a significant challenge to the fairness of LLM evaluations in natural language processing tasks by inadvertently exposing models to test data during training. Current studies attempt to mitigate this issue by modifying existing datasets or generating new ones from freshly collected information. However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoreEval}, a \textbf{Co}ntamination-\textbf{re}silient \textbf{Eval}uation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant, up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism is employed to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets. Extensive experiments on updated datasets validate the robustness of CoreEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating performance overestimation caused by data contamination.",human
"Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in ensuring both privacy and communication efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as Internet of Things (IoT) and edge networks. While sign-based methods, such as sign stochastic gradient descent with majority voting (SIGNSGD-MV), offer substantial bandwidth savings, they remain vulnerable to inference attacks due to exposure of gradient signs. Existing secure aggregation techniques are either incompatible with sign-based methods or incur prohibitive overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Hi-SAFE, a lightweight and cryptographically secure aggregation framework for sign-based FL. Our core contribution is the construction of efficient majority vote polynomials for SIGNSGD-MV, derived from Fermat's Little Theorem. This formulation represents the majority vote as a low-degree polynomial over a finite field, enabling secure evaluation that hides intermediate values and reveals only the final result. We further introduce a hierarchical subgrouping strategy that ensures constant multiplicative depth and bounded per-user complexity, independent of the number of users n.",human
"In this work, we investigate how implicit neural feed back can accelerate reinforcement learning in complex robotic manipulation settings. While prior electroencephalogram (EEG) guided reinforcement learning studies have primarily focused on navigation or low-dimensional locomotion tasks, we aim to understand whether such neural evaluative signals can improve policy learning in high-dimensional manipulation tasks involving obstacles and precise end-effector control. We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based reinforcement learning can scale beyond locomotion tasks and provide a viable pathway for human-aligned manipulation skill acquisition.",human
"The increasing use of machine learning in sensitive applications demands algorithms that simultaneously preserve data privacy and ensure fairness across potentially sensitive sub-populations. While privacy and fairness have each been extensively studied, their joint treatment remains poorly understood. Existing research often frames them as conflicting objectives, with multiple studies suggesting that strong privacy notions such as differential privacy inevitably compromise fairness. In this work, we challenge that perspective by showing that differential privacy can be integrated into a fairness-enhancing pipeline with minimal impact on fairness guarantees. We design a postprocessing algorithm, called DP2DP, that enforces both demographic parity and differential privacy. Our analysis reveals that our algorithm converges towards its demographic parity objective at essentially the same rate (up logarithmic factor) as the best non-private methods from the literature. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm our theoretical results, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy/fairness/privacy trade-offs.",human
"Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.",human
"Since the introduction of the GRPO algorithm, reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention, with growing efforts to reproduce and apply it. However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application.",human

"High quality kernels are critical for reducing training and inference costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they traditionally require significant expertise in hardware architecture and software optimization. While recent advances in LLM-based code generation show promise for complex optimization, existing methods struggle with the vast optimization space due to insufficient hardware domain knowledge, failing to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates. Extensive experiments on TritonBench demonstrate that KernelBand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens while exhibiting consistent improvement without saturation as computational resources increase.",human
"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, their long chain-of-thought reasoning processes incur significant inference overhead. Pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reducing computational costs. However, existing efforts have primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), while pruning LRMs remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study on pruning LRMs and show that directly applying existing pruning techniques fails to yield satisfactory results. Our findings indicate that using self-generated reasoning data for calibration can substantially improve pruning performance. We further investigate how the difficulty and length of reasoning data affect pruning outcomes. Our analysis reveals that challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data serve as ideal calibration data. Based on these insights, we propose a Selective Self-Generated Reasoning (SSGR) data construction strategy to provide effective calibration data for pruning LRMs. Experimental results on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series validate that our strategy improves the reasoning ability of pruned LRMs by 10%-13% compared to general pruning methods.",human
"With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the applications of LLMs have grown substantially. In the education domain, LLMs demonstrate significant potential, particularly in automatic text generation, which enables the creation of intelligent and adaptive learning content. This paper proposes a new LLMs framework, which is named as Reading Comprehension Exercise Generation (RCEG). It can generate high-quality and personalized English reading comprehension exercises automatically. Firstly, RCEG uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate content candidates. Then, it uses a discriminator to select the best candidate. Finally, the quality of the generated content has been improved greatly. To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results. These metrics include content diversity, factual accuracy, linguistic toxicity, and pedagogical alignment. Experimental results show that RCEG significantly improves the relevance and cognitive appropriateness of the generated exercises.",human
"Recently, fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained GNNs has yielded remarkable attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method.",human
"Scaling vision-language-action (VLA) model pre-training requires large volumes of diverse, high-quality manipulation trajectories. Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models.",human
"The main goal of the project is to design a new model that predicts regions of interest in 360$^{\circ}$ videos. The region of interest (ROI) plays an important role in 360$^{\circ}$ video streaming. For example, ROIs are used to predict view-ports, intelligently cut the videos for live streaming, etc so that less bandwidth is used. Detecting view-ports in advance helps reduce the movement of the head while streaming and watching a video via the head-mounted device. Whereas, intelligent cuts of the videos help improve the efficiency of streaming the video to users and enhance the quality of their viewing experience. This report illustrates the secondary task to identify ROIs, in which, we design, train, and test a hybrid saliency model. In this work, we refer to saliency regions to represent the regions of interest. The method includes the processes as follows: preprocessing the video to obtain frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for predicting the region of interest, and finally post-processing the output predictions of the hybrid saliency model to obtain the output region of interest for each frame. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the subjective annotations of the 360RAT dataset.",human
"We present a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Git bisect process for semantic fault localization. Traditional bisect assumes deterministic predicates and binary failure states assumptions often violated in modern software development due to flaky tests, nonmonotonic regressions, and semantic divergence from upstream repositories. Our system augments bisect traversal with structured chain of thought reasoning, enabling commit by commit analysis under noisy conditions. We evaluate multiple open source and proprietary LLMs for their suitability and fine tune DeepSeekCoderV2 using QLoRA on a curated dataset of semantically labeled diffs. We adopt a weak supervision workflow to reduce annotation overhead, incorporating human in the loop corrections and self consistency filtering. Experiments across multiple open source projects show a 6.4 point absolute gain in success rate from 74.2 to 80.6 percent, leading to significantly fewer failed traversals and by experiment up to 2x reduction in average bisect time. We conclude with discussions on temporal reasoning, prompt design, and finetuning strategies tailored for commit level behavior analysis.",human
"Content moderation filters are a critical safeguard against alignment failures in language models. Yet most existing filters focus narrowly on general safety and overlook cultural context. In this work, we introduce FanarGuard, a bilingual moderation filter that evaluates both safety and cultural alignment in Arabic and English. We construct a dataset of over 468K prompt and response pairs, drawn from synthetic and public datasets, scored by a panel of LLM judges on harmlessness and cultural awareness, and use it to train two filter variants. To rigorously evaluate cultural alignment, we further develop the first benchmark targeting Arabic cultural contexts, comprising over 1k norm-sensitive prompts with LLM-generated responses annotated by human raters. Results show that FanarGuard achieves stronger agreement with human annotations than inter-annotator reliability, while matching the performance of state-of-the-art filters on safety benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cultural awareness into moderation and establish FanarGuard as a practical step toward more context-sensitive safeguards.",human
"Discovering effective predictive signals, or ``alphas,'' from financial data with high dimensionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio remains a difficult open problem. Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly. Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps. To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space. Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods. Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery. All source code will be released.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into code editors to provide AI-powered code suggestions. Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms. The filter operates solely on pre-invocation editor telemetry and never inspects code or prompts.",human
"Text summarization is the task of automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning and key information. Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored. This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.   In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings. In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech. Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech. We introduce a new dataset, Posel od Čerchova, designed for the summarization of historical Czech texts. This dataset is derived from digitized 19th-century publications and annotated for abstractive summarization. We provide initial baselines using modern LLMs to facilitate further research in this underrepresented area.   By combining cutting-edge models with both modern and historical Czech datasets, our work lays the foundation for further progress in Czech summarization and contributes valuable resources for future research in Czech historical document processing and low-resource summarization more broadly.",human
"Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.",human
"Due to the inherent complexity, temporal patterns in real-world time series often evolve across multiple intertwined scales, including long-term periodicity, short-term fluctuations, and abrupt regime shifts. While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate WaveTuner achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in time series forecasting.",human
"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instruction--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.",human
"Focus group discussions generate rich qualitative data but their analysis traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual coding that limits scalability and reproducibility. We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578). Our framework provides practical guidelines that researchers can adapt to their own qualitative research contexts. All code, data processing scripts, and evaluation protocols are publicly available to support reproduction and extension of this work.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code auto-completion by generating context-aware suggestions. Yet, deciding when to present these suggestions remains underexplored, often leading to interruptions or wasted inference calls. We propose an adaptive timing mechanism that dynamically adjusts the delay before offering a suggestion based on real-time developer feedback. Our suggested method combines a logistic transform of recent acceptance rates with a bounded delay range, anchored by a high-level binary prediction of the developer's cognitive state. In a two-month deployment with professional developers, our system improved suggestion acceptance from 4.9% with no delay to 15.4% with static delays, and to 18.6% with adaptive timing-while reducing blind rejections (rejections without being read) from 8.3% to 0.36%. Together, these improvements increase acceptance and substantially reduce wasted inference calls by 75%, making LLM-based code assistants more efficient and cost-effective in practice.",human
"Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) faces persistent challenges, including domain heterogeneity from diverse client data, data imbalance due to skewed participation, and strict communication constraints. Traditional federated learning often lacks personalization, as a single global model cannot capture client-specific characteristics, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization, especially for clients with highly divergent data distributions.   To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization.   Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost.",human
"The adaptation of teaching slides to instructors' situated teaching needs, including pedagogical styles and their students' context, is a critical yet time-consuming task for educators. Through a series of educator interviews, we first identify and systematically categorize the key friction points that impede this adaptation process. Grounded in these findings, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to automate slide adaptation based on high-level instructor specifications. An evaluation involving 16 modification requests across 8 real-world courses validates our approach. The framework's output consistently achieved high scores in intent alignment, content coherence and factual accuracy, and performed on par with baseline methods regarding visual clarity, while also demonstrating appropriate timeliness and a high operational agreement with human experts, achieving an F1 score of 0.89. This work heralds a new paradigm where AI agents handle the logistical burdens of instructional design, liberating educators to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of teaching.",human
"The utility of deep learning models, such as CheXNet, in high stakes clinical settings is fundamentally constrained by their purely deterministic nature, failing to provide reliable measures of predictive confidence. This project addresses this critical gap by integrating robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into a high performance diagnostic platform for 14 common thoracic diseases on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). This resulting DE successfully stabilized performance and delivered superior reliability, achieving a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.8559 and an average F1 Score of 0.3857. Crucially, the DE demonstrated superior calibration (Mean ECE of 0.0728 and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916) and enabled the reliable decomposition of total uncertainty into its Aleatoric (irreducible data noise) and Epistemic (reducible model knowledge) components, with a mean Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) of 0.0240. These results establish the Deep Ensemble as a trustworthy and explainable platform, transforming the model from a probabilistic tool into a reliable clinical decision support system.",human
"This paper introduces HGNN(O), an AutoML GNN hypermodel framework for outcome prediction on event-sequence data. Building on our earlier work on graph convolutional network hypermodels, HGNN(O) extends four architectures-One Level, Two Level, Two Level Pseudo Embedding, and Two Level Embedding-across six canonical GNN operators. A self-tuning mechanism based on Bayesian optimization with pruning and early stopping enables efficient adaptation over architectures and hyperparameters without manual configuration. Empirical evaluation on both balanced and imbalanced event logs shows that HGNN(O) achieves accuracy exceeding 0.98 on the Traffic Fines dataset and weighted F1 scores up to 0.86 on the Patients dataset without explicit imbalance handling. These results demonstrate that the proposed AutoML-GNN approach provides a robust and generalizable benchmark for outcome prediction in complex event-sequence data.",human
"With the success of flow matching in visual generation, sampling efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for its practical application. Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality. Our experiment result on SD3 demonstrates our method's efficacy.",human
"Deep neural networks are prone to learning shortcuts, spurious and easily learned correlations in training data that cause severe failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals. The result is state-of-the-art OOD performance on established shortcut learning benchmarks.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) face information overload when handling long contexts, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) where extensive supporting documents often introduce redundant content. This issue not only weakens reasoning accuracy but also increases computational overhead. We propose an unsupervised context compression framework that exploits Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to preserve semantically essential information while filtering out irrelevant text. By quantifying node-level entropy within AMR graphs, our method estimates the conceptual importance of each node, enabling the retention of core semantics. Specifically, we construct AMR graphs from raw contexts, compute the conceptual entropy of each node, and screen significant informative nodes to form a condensed and semantically focused context than raw documents. Experiments on the PopQA and EntityQuestions datasets show that our method outperforms vanilla and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing context length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work introducing AMR-based conceptual entropy for context compression, demonstrating the potential of stable linguistic features in context engineering.",human
"Existing deep learning models for Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) struggle with temporal irregularities, particularly stochastic event durations and overlapping timestamps, limiting their adaptability across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a dual input neural network strategy that separates event and sequence attributes, using a duration-aware pseudo-embedding matrix to transform temporal importance into compact, learnable representations. This design is implemented across two baseline families: B-LSTM and B-GCN, and their duration-aware variants D-LSTM and D-GCN. All models incorporate self-tuned hypermodels for adaptive architecture selection. Experiments on balanced and imbalanced outcome prediction tasks show that duration pseudo-embedding inputs consistently improve generalization, reduce model complexity, and enhance interpretability. Our results demonstrate the benefits of explicit temporal encoding and provide a flexible design for robust, real-world PPM applications.",human
"Heart rate estimation from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals generated by wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers has significant implications for the health and well-being of individuals. Although prior work has demonstrated deep learning models with strong performance in the heart rate estimation task, in order to deploy these models on wearable devices, these models must also adhere to strict memory and latency constraints. In this work, we explore and characterize how large pre-trained PPG models may be distilled to smaller models appropriate for real-time inference on the edge. We evaluate four distillation strategies through comprehensive sweeps of teacher and student model capacities: (1) hard distillation, (2) soft distillation, (3) decoupled knowledge distillation (DKD), and (4) feature distillation. We present a characterization of the resulting scaling laws describing the relationship between model size and performance. This early investigation lays the groundwork for practical and predictable methods for building edge-deployable models for physiological sensing.",human
"Over the last few months, AI models including large language models have improved greatly. There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.   Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.",human
"Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large teacher networks to compact student models. However, traditional knowledge distillation methods treat all teacher predictions equally, regardless of the teacher's confidence in those predictions. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware dual-student knowledge distillation framework that leverages teacher prediction uncertainty to selectively guide student learning. We introduce a peer-learning mechanism where two heterogeneous student architectures, specifically ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2, learn collaboratively from both the teacher network and each other. Experimental results on ImageNet-100 demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline knowledge distillation methods, with ResNet-18 achieving 83.84\% top-1 accuracy and MobileNetV2 achieving 81.46\% top-1 accuracy, representing improvements of 2.04\% and 0.92\% respectively over traditional single-student distillation approaches.",human
"Figuring out which objects or concepts words refer to is a central language learning challenge for young children. Most models of this process posit that children learn early object labels from co-occurrences of words and their referents that occur when someone around them talks about an object in the immediate physical environment. But how aligned in time are children's visual and linguistic experiences during everyday learning? To date, answers to this question have been limited by the need for labor-intensive manual annotations of vision-language co-occurrences. Here, we evaluate the use of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective in home environments. After validating CLIP alignment scores using human alignment judgments, we apply this metric to a large corpus of infant-perspective videos. We show that idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., ""look at the ball"" with a ball present in the child's view) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences compared to modern machine learning datasets, and highlight variability in alignment both within and across children. These findings suggest that infrequent alignment is a constraint for models describing early word learning and offer a new method for investigating children's multimodal environment.",human
"We present a meshless method for the solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in advection-dominated regimes using physics- and equality-constrained artificial neural networks combined with a conditionally adaptive augmented Lagrangian formulation. A single neural network parameterizes both the velocity and pressure fields, and is trained by minimizing the residual of a Poisson's equation for pressure, constrained by the momentum and continuity equations, together with boundary conditions on the velocity field. No boundary conditions are imposed on the pressure field aside from anchoring the pressure at a point to prevent its unbounded development. The training is performed from scratch without labeled data, relying solely on the governing equations and constraints. To enhance accuracy in advection-dominated flows, we employ a single Fourier feature mapping of the input coordinates. The proposed method is demonstrated for the canonical lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 7,500 and for laminar flow over a circular cylinder with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, achieving excellent agreement with benchmark solutions. We further compare the present formulation against alternative objective-function constructions based on different arrangements of the flow equations, thereby highlighting the algorithmic advantages of the proposed formulation centered around the Poisson's equation for pressure.",human
"Understanding complete musical scores requires reasoning over symbolic structures such as pitch, rhythm, harmony, and form. Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in natural language and multimodal tasks, their ability to comprehend musical notation remains underexplored. We introduce Musical Score Understanding Benchmark (MSU-Bench), the first large-scale, human-curated benchmark for evaluating score-level musical understanding across both textual (ABC notation) and visual (PDF) modalities. MSU-Bench comprises 1,800 generative question-answer (QA) pairs drawn from works spanning Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, and others, organised into four progressive levels of comprehension: Onset Information, Notation & Note, Chord & Harmony, and Texture & Form. Through extensive zero-shot and fine-tuned evaluations of over 15+ state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we reveal sharp modality gaps, fragile level-wise success rates, and the difficulty of sustaining multilevel correctness. Fine-tuning markedly improves performance in both modalities while preserving general knowledge, establishing MSU-Bench as a rigorous foundation for future research at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), musicological, and multimodal reasoning.",human
"Persistent homology (PH) is a crucial concept in computational topology, providing a multiscale topological description of a space. It is particularly significant in topological data analysis, which aims to make statistical inference from a topological perspective. In this work, we introduce a new topological summary for Bayesian neural networks, termed the predictive topological uncertainty (pTU). The proposed pTU measures the uncertainty in the interaction between the model and the inputs. It provides insights from the model perspective: if two samples interact with a model in a similar way, then they are considered identically distributed. We also show that the pTU is insensitive to the model architecture. As an application, pTU is used to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, which is critical to ensure model reliability. Failure to detect OOD input can lead to incorrect and unreliable predictions. To address this issue, we propose a significance test for OOD based on the pTU, providing a statistical framework for this issue. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through various experiments, in terms of its statistical power, sensitivity, and robustness.",human
"Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.",human
"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge, helping mitigate hallucinations and enhance domain-specific expertise. Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines.",human
"Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.",human
"Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.",human
"We study the problem of excess risk evaluation for empirical risk minimization (ERM) under general convex loss functions. Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class. As a result, the method is essentially model-free and holds significant promise for theoretically evaluating modern opaque machine learning system--such as deep nerral networks and generative model--where traditional capacity-based learning theory becomes infeasible due to the extreme complexity of the hypothesis class.",human
"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on multimodal benchmarks but lag behind humans and specialized models on visual perception tasks like depth estimation or object counting. Finetuning on one task can unpredictably affect performance on others, making task-specific finetuning challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge through a systematic study of task transferability. We examine how finetuning a VLM on one perception task affects its zero-shot performance on others. To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.",human
"Hypergraphs, as a generalization of traditional graphs, naturally capture high-order relationships. In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have been widely used to capture complex high-order relationships. However, most existing hypergraph neural network methods inherently rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios that exhibit significant heterophilic structures. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{HONOR}, a novel unsupervised \textbf{H}ypergraph c\textbf{ON}trastive learning framework suitable for both hom\textbf{O}philic and hete\textbf{R}ophilic hypergraphs. Specifically, HONOR explicitly models the heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures the diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges. Combined with high-pass filtering, these designs enable HONOR to fully exploit heterophilic connection patterns, yielding more discriminative and robust node and hyperedge representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate the superior generalization ability and robustness of HONOR. Empirically, extensive experiments further validate that HONOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.",human
"Streamline classification is essential to identify anatomically meaningful white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, current streamline classification methods rely primarily on the geometric features of the streamline trajectory, failing to distinguish between functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways. To address this, we introduce a novel dual-stream streamline classification framework that jointly analyzes dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) data to enhance the functional coherence of tract parcellation. We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions. We demonstrate our method by parcellating the corticospinal tract (CST) into its four somatotopic subdivisions. Experimental results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approach's superior performance.",human
"Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.

"Neural operators have shown great potential in solving a family of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by modeling the mappings between input and output functions. Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) implements global convolutions via parameterizing the integral operators in Fourier space. However, it often results in over-smoothing solutions and fails to capture local details and high-frequency components. To address these limitations, we investigate incorporating the spatial-frequency localization property of Wavelet transforms into the Transformer architecture. We propose a novel Wavelet Attention (WA) module with linear computational complexity to efficiently learn locality-aware features. Building upon WA, we further develop the Spectral Attention Operator Transformer (SAOT), a hybrid spectral Transformer framework that integrates WA's localized focus with the global receptive field of Fourier-based Attention (FA) through a gated fusion block. Experimental results demonstrate that WA significantly mitigates the limitations of FA and outperforms existing Wavelet-based neural operators by a large margin. By integrating the locality-aware and global spectral representations, SAOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six operator learning benchmarks and exhibits strong discretization-invariant ability.",human
"Virtual Try-On (VTON) is the task of synthesizing an image of a person wearing a target garment, conditioned on a person image and a garment image. While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.",human
"Low-resource ASR remains a challenging problem, especially for languages like Arabic that exhibit wide dialectal variation and limited labeled data. We propose context-aware prompting strategies to adapt OpenAI's Whisper for Arabic speech recognition without retraining. Our methods include decoder prompting with first-pass transcriptions or retrieved utterances, and encoder prefixing using speech synthesized in the target speaker's voice. We introduce techniques such as prompt reordering, speaker-aware prefix synthesis, and modality-specific retrieval (lexical, semantic, acoustic) to improve transcription in real-world, zero-shot settings. Evaluated on nine Arabic linguistic conditions, our approach reduces WER by up to 22.3% on Modern Standard Arabic and 9.2% on dialectal speech, significantly mitigating hallucinations and speaker mismatch.",human
"Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in semi-supervised learning (SSL), especially when distributional mismatches between labeled and unlabeled data lead to biased classification. Although existing methods address this issue by adjusting logits based on the estimated class distribution of unlabeled data, they often handle model imbalance in a coarse-grained manner, conflating data imbalance with bias arising from varying class-specific learning difficulties. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes. In the inference phase, we further analyze the weight imbalance of the linear classifier and apply post-hoc sampling control with an optimization bias vector to directly calibrate the logits. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets and distribution settings validate the consistency and state-of-the-art performance of SC-SSL.",human
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become valuable intellectual property of model owners, due to the substantial resources required for their development. To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC. This shows that ADALOC can offer a practical solution for adaptive and protected DNN deployment in evolving real-world scenarios.",human
"Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.",human
"Informal mathematics has been central to modern large language model (LLM) reasoning, offering flexibility and enabling efficient construction of arguments. However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs. The implementation and codebase are publicly available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/HERMES.",human
"Detecting driver drowsiness reliably is crucial for enhancing road safety and supporting advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection. At the same time, synthetic augmentation expands the diversity of training data for drowsiness recognition. Our findings highlight the ELA as both a reliable biometric measure and a powerful tool for generating scalable datasets in driver state monitoring.",human
"As posts on social media increase rapidly, analyzing the sentiments embedded in image-text pairs has become a popular research topic in recent years. Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis.",human
"Statistical inference from data generated by multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms is challenging due to their adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature. A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality.   Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have raised hopes for automated end-to-end fact-checking, but prior studies report mixed results. As mainstream chatbots increasingly ship with reasoning capabilities and web search tools -- and millions of users already rely on them for verification -- rigorous evaluation is urgent. We evaluate 15 recent LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek on more than 6,000 claims fact-checked by PolitiFact, comparing standard models with reasoning- and web-search variants. Standard models perform poorly, reasoning offers minimal benefits, and web search provides only moderate gains, despite fact-checks being available on the web. In contrast, a curated RAG system using PolitiFact summaries improved macro F1 by 233% on average across model variants. These findings suggest that giving models access to curated high-quality context is a promising path for automated fact-checking.",human
"While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{""GPT moment""} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.",human
"Large language models are evolving from single-turn responders into tool-using agents capable of sustained reasoning and decision-making for deep research. Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks.",human
"Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.",human
"Time series anomaly detection is widely used in IoT and cyber-physical systems, yet its evaluation remains challenging due to diverse application objectives and heterogeneous metric assumptions. This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection.",human
"In this work, we define Foresight Intelligence as the capability to anticipate and interpret future events-an ability essential for applications such as autonomous driving, yet largely overlooked by existing research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.",human
"Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical ""City-District-Grid"" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a ""produce-refine-evaluate"" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.",human
"Global ocean forecasting aims to predict key ocean variables such as temperature, salinity, and currents, which is essential for understanding and describing oceanic phenomena. In recent years, data-driven deep learning-based ocean forecast models, such as XiHe, WenHai, LangYa and AI-GOMS, have demonstrated significant potential in capturing complex ocean dynamics and improving forecasting efficiency. Despite these advancements, the absence of open-source, standardized benchmarks has led to inconsistent data usage and evaluation methods. This gap hinders efficient model development, impedes fair performance comparison, and constrains interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this challenge, we propose OceanForecastBench, a benchmark offering three core contributions: (1) A high-quality global ocean reanalysis data over 28 years for model training, including 4 ocean variables across 23 depth levels and 4 sea surface variables. (2) A high-reliability satellite and in-situ observations for model evaluation, covering approximately 100 million locations in the global ocean. (3) An evaluation pipeline and a comprehensive benchmark with 6 typical baseline models, leveraging observations to evaluate model performance from multiple perspectives. OceanForecastBench represents the most comprehensive benchmarking framework currently available for data-driven ocean forecasting, offering an open-source platform for model development, evaluation, and comparison. The dataset and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Ocean-Intelligent-Forecasting/OceanForecastBench.",human
"Football (soccer) is a sport that is characterised by complex game play, where players perform a variety of actions, such as passes, shots, tackles, fouls, in order to score goals, and ultimately win matches. Accurately forecasting the total number of each action that each player will complete during a match is desirable for a variety of applications, including tactical decision-making, sports betting, and for television broadcast commentary and analysis. Such predictions must consider the game state, the ability and skill of the players in both teams, the interactions between the players, and the temporal dynamics of the game as it develops. In this paper, we present a transformer-based neural network that jointly and recurrently predicts the expected totals for thirteen individual actions at multiple time-steps during the match, and where predictions are made for each individual player, each team and at the game-level. The neural network is based on an \emph{axial transformer} that efficiently captures the temporal dynamics as the game progresses, and the interactions between the players at each time-step. We present a novel axial transformer design that we show is equivalent to a regular sequential transformer, and the design performs well experimentally. We show empirically that the model can make consistent and reliable predictions, and efficiently makes $\sim$75,000 live predictions at low latency for each game.",human
"The transition to autonomous material systems necessitates adaptive control methodologies to maximize structural longevity. This study frames the self-healing process as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem within a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling agents to autonomously derive optimal policies that efficiently balance structural integrity maintenance against finite resource consumption. A comparative evaluation of discrete-action (Q-learning, DQN) and continuous-action (TD3) agents in a stochastic simulation environment revealed that RL controllers significantly outperform heuristic baselines, achieving near-complete material recovery. Crucially, the TD3 agent utilizing continuous dosage control demonstrated superior convergence speed and stability, underscoring the necessity of fine-grained, proportional actuation in dynamic self-healing applications.",human
"Aircraft maintenance logs hold valuable safety data but remain underused due to their unstructured text format. This paper introduces LogSyn, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert these logs into structured, machine-readable data. Using few-shot in-context learning on 6,169 records, LogSyn performs Controlled Abstraction Generation (CAG) to summarize problem-resolution narratives and classify events within a detailed hierarchical ontology. The framework identifies key failure patterns, offering a scalable method for semantic structuring and actionable insight extraction from maintenance logs. This work provides a practical path to improve maintenance workflows and predictive analytics in aviation and related industries.",human
"Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their ever-growing scale poses severe challenges for deployment and efficiency. Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.",human
"Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.",human
"The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.",human
"We introduce AIRHILT (Aviation Integrated Reasoning, Human-in-the-Loop Testbed), a modular and lightweight simulation environment designed to evaluate multimodal pilot and air traffic control (ATC) assistance systems for aviation conflict detection. Built on the open-source Godot engine, AIRHILT synchronizes pilot and ATC radio communications, visual scene understanding from camera streams, and ADS-B surveillance data within a unified, scalable platform. The environment supports pilot- and controller-in-the-loop interactions, providing a comprehensive scenario suite covering both terminal area and en route operational conflicts, including communication errors and procedural mistakes. AIRHILT offers standardized JSON-based interfaces that enable researchers to easily integrate, swap, and evaluate automatic speech recognition (ASR), visual detection, decision-making, and text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate AIRHILT through a reference pipeline incorporating fine-tuned Whisper ASR, YOLO-based visual detection, ADS-B-based conflict logic, and GPT-OSS-20B structured reasoning, and present preliminary results from representative runway-overlap scenarios, where the assistant achieves an average time-to-first-warning of approximately 7.7 s, with average ASR and vision latencies of approximately 5.9 s and 0.4 s, respectively.

"Sequential recommendation models user preferences to predict the next target item. Most existing work is passive, where the system responds only when users open the application, missing chances after closure. We investigate active recommendation, which predicts the next interaction time and actively delivers items. Two challenges: accurately estimating the Time of Interest (ToI) and generating Item of Interest (IoI) conditioned on the predicted ToI. We propose PASRec, a diffusion-based framework that aligns ToI and IoI via a joint objective. Experiments on five benchmarks show superiority over eight state-of-the-art baselines under leave-one-out and temporal splits.",human
"Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.",human
"Graph transformers have demonstrated remarkable capability on complex spatio-temporal tasks, yet their depth is often limited by oversmoothing and weak long-range dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in their ability to interact with external interfaces. Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini.",human
"Educational illustrations play a central role in communicating abstract concepts, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain limited in producing pedagogically coherent and semantically consistent educational visuals. We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp). Across all model backbones, MAGMA-Edu achieves the highest scores (Avg-Text 96.20, ITC 99.12), establishing a new state of the art for multimodal educational content generation and demonstrating the effectiveness of self-reflective multi-agent collaboration in pedagogically aligned vision-language reasoning.",human
"In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods.",human
"Decentralized learning often involves a weighted global loss with heterogeneous node weights $λ$. We revisit two natural strategies for incorporating these weights: (i) embedding them into the local losses to retain a uniform weight (and thus a doubly stochastic matrix), and (ii) keeping the original losses while employing a $λ$-induced row-stochastic matrix. Although prior work shows that both strategies yield the same expected descent direction for the global loss, it remains unclear whether the Euclidean-space guarantees are tight and what fundamentally differentiates their behaviors. To clarify this, we develop a weighted Hilbert-space framework $L^2(λ;\mathbb{R}^d)$ and obtain convergence rates that are strictly tighter than those from Euclidean analysis. In this geometry, the row-stochastic matrix becomes self-adjoint whereas the doubly stochastic one does not, creating additional penalty terms that amplify consensus error, thereby slowing convergence. Consequently, the difference in convergence arises not only from spectral gaps but also from these penalty terms. We then derive sufficient conditions under which the row-stochastic design converges faster even with a smaller spectral gap. Finally, by using a Rayleigh-quotient and Loewner-order eigenvalue comparison, we further obtain topology conditions that guarantee this advantage and yield practical topology-design guidelines.",human
"Video editing and synthesis often introduce object inconsistencies, such as frame flicker and identity drift that degrade perceptual quality. To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed ""consistent"" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets.",human
"In real-world scenarios of image recognition, there exists substantial noise interference. Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments.",human
"This paper presents the design, implementation, and evolution of a comprehensive multimodal room-monitoring system that integrates synchronized video and audio processing for real-time activity recognition and anomaly detection. We describe two iterations of the system: an initial lightweight implementation using YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and an advanced version that incorporates multi-model audio ensembles, hybrid object detection, bidirectional cross-modal attention, and multi-method anomaly detection. The evolution demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and industrial applicability. The advanced system combines three audio models (AST, Wav2Vec2, and HuBERT) for comprehensive audio understanding, dual object detectors (YOLO and DETR) for improved accuracy, and sophisticated fusion mechanisms for enhanced cross-modal learning. Experimental evaluation shows the system's effectiveness in general monitoring scenarios as well as specialized industrial safety applications, achieving real-time performance on standard hardware while maintaining high accuracy.",human
"This report presents the Empathetic Cascading Networks (ECN) framework, a multi-stage prompting method designed to enhance the empathetic and inclusive capabilities of large language models. ECN employs four stages: Perspective Adoption, Emotional Resonance, Reflective Understanding, and Integrative Synthesis, to guide models toward generating emotionally resonant and contextually aware responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ECN achieves the highest Empathy Quotient (EQ) scores across GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, while maintaining competitive Regard and Perplexity metrics. These findings emphasize ECN's potential for applications requiring empathy and inclusivity in conversational AI.",human
"Accurate localization is essential for marine robotics, yet Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable or unavailable even at a very short distance below the water surface. Traditional alternatives, such as inertial navigation, Doppler Velocity Loggers (DVL), SLAM, and acoustic methods, suffer from error accumulation, high computational demands, or infrastructure dependence. In this work, we present a scalable multi-drone GNSS-based tracking system for surface and near-surface marine robots. Our approach combines efficient visual detection, lightweight multi-object tracking, GNSS-based triangulation, and a confidence-weighted Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to provide stable GNSS estimation in real time. We further introduce a cross-drone tracking ID alignment algorithm that enforces global consistency across views, enabling robust multi-robot tracking with redundant aerial coverage. We validate our system in diversified complex settings to show the scalability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",human
"Edge deployment of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly relies on flash-based weight offloading, where activation sparsification is used to reduce I/O overhead. However, conventional sparsification remains model-centric, selecting neurons solely by activation magnitude and neglecting how access patterns influence flash performance. We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency. By aligning sparsification decisions with the underlying storage behavior, Neuron Chunking improves I/O efficiency by up to 4.65x and 5.76x on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively.",human
"Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) represent a new class of neural architectures that replace conventional linear transformations and node-based nonlinearities with spline-based function approximations distributed along network edges. Although KANs offer strong expressivity and interpretability, their heterogeneous spline and base branch parameters hinder efficient quantization, which remains unexamined compared to CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we present QuantKAN, a unified framework for quantizing KANs across both quantization aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) regimes. QuantKAN extends modern quantization algorithms, such as LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa, QIL, GPTQ, BRECQ, AdaRound, AWQ, and HAWQ-V2, to spline based layers with branch-specific quantizers for base, spline, and activation components. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR 10, and CIFAR 100 across multiple KAN variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN), we establish the first systematic benchmarks for low-bit spline networks. Our results show that KANs, particularly deeper KAGN variants, are compatible with low-bit quantization but exhibit strong method architecture interactions: LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT preserve near full precision accuracy at 4 bit for shallow KAN MLP and ConvNet models, while DoReFa provides the most stable behavior for deeper KAGN under aggressive low-bit settings. For PTQ, GPTQ and Uniform consistently deliver the strongest overall performance across datasets, with BRECQ highly competitive on simpler regimes such as MNIST. Our proposed QuantKAN framework thus unifies spline learning and quantization, and provides practical tools and guidelines for efficiently deploying KANs in real-world, resource-constrained environments.",human
"Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.",human
"Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., ""Is this normal or abnormal?"") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at https://medvision-vlm.github.io.",human
"Large matrix multiplication is a cornerstone of modern machine learning workloads, yet traditional approaches suffer from cubic computational complexity (e.g., $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for a matrix of size $n\times n$). We present Low-Rank GEMM, a novel approach that leverages low-rank matrix approximations to achieve sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining hardware-accelerated performance through FP8 precision and intelligent kernel selection. On a NVIDIA RTX 4090, our implementation achieves up to 378 TFLOPS on matrices up to $N=20480$, providing 75\% memory savings and $7.8\times$ speedup over PyTorch FP32 for large matrices. The system automatically adapts to hardware capabilities, selecting optimal decomposition methods (SVD, randomized SVD) and precision levels based on matrix characteristics and available accelerators. Comprehensive benchmarking on NVIDIA RTX 4090 demonstrates that Low-Rank GEMM becomes the fastest approach for matrices $N\geq10240$, surpassing traditional cuBLAS implementations through memory bandwidth optimization rather than computational shortcuts.",human
"Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), where centralized critics leverage global information to guide decentralized actors. However, centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) arises when the suboptimal behavior of one agent degrades others' learning. Prior approaches mitigate CDM through value decomposition, but linear decompositions allow per-agent gradients at the cost of limited expressiveness, while nonlinear decompositions improve representation but require centralized gradients, reintroducing CDM. To overcome this trade-off, we propose the multi-agent cross-entropy method (MCEM), combined with monotonic nonlinear critic decomposition (NCD). MCEM updates policies by increasing the probability of high-value joint actions, thereby excluding suboptimal behaviors. For sample efficiency, we extend off-policy learning with a modified k-step return and Retrace. Analysis and experiments demonstrate that MCEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both continuous and discrete action benchmarks.",human
"Replacing modules in pretrained models, especially swapping quadratic self-attention for efficient attention alternatives, poses a hard optimization problem: cold-start reinitialization destabilizes frozen backbones. We isolate this core stability challenge in a controlled study. Deterministic Continuous Replacement (DCR) blends teacher and student outputs with a deterministic, annealed weight. Theoretically, DCR eliminates gate-induced gradient variance inherent to stochastic replacement. In a single-seed study, DCR attains faster convergence and stronger alignment than stochastic gating and distillation baselines on controlled attention replacement, establishing a foundation for heterogeneous operator swaps.",human
"Traditional vision-based material perception methods often experience substantial performance degradation under visually impaired conditions, thereby motivating the shift toward non-visual multimodal material perception. Despite this, existing approaches frequently perform naive fusion of multimodal inputs, overlooking key challenges such as modality-specific noise, missing modalities common in real-world scenarios, and the dynamically varying importance of each modality depending on the task. These limitations lead to suboptimal performance across several benchmark tasks. In this paper, we propose a robust multimodal fusion framework, TouchFormer. Specifically, we employ a Modality-Adaptive Gating (MAG) mechanism and intra- and inter-modality attention mechanisms to adaptively integrate cross-modal features, enhancing model robustness. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Instance Embedding Regularization(CER) strategy, which significantly improves classification accuracy in fine-grained subcategory material recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing non-visual methods, the proposed TouchFormer framework achieves classification accuracy improvements of 2.48% and 6.83% on SSMC and USMC tasks, respectively. Furthermore, real-world robotic experiments validate TouchFormer's effectiveness in enabling robots to better perceive and interpret their environment, paving the way for its deployment in safety-critical applications such as emergency response and industrial automation. The code and datasets will be open-source, and the videos are available in the supplementary materials.",human
"Equivariant imaging (EI) enables training signal reconstruction models without requiring ground truth data by leveraging signal symmetries. Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) are a powerful class of neural networks where the output is a fixed point of a learned operator. However, training DEQs with complex EI losses requires implicit differentiation through fixed-point computations, whose implementation can be challenging. We show that backpropagation can be implemented modularly, simplifying training. Experiments demonstrate that DEQs trained with implicit differentiation outperform those trained with Jacobian-free backpropagation and other baseline methods. Additionally, we find evidence that EI-trained DEQs approximate the proximal map of an invariant prior.",human
"Scaling laws describe how learning performance improves with data, compute, or training time, and have become a central theme in modern deep learning. We study this phenomenon in a canonical nonlinear model: phase retrieval with anisotropic Gaussian inputs whose covariance spectrum follows a power law. Unlike the isotropic case, where dynamics collapse to a two-dimensional system, anisotropy yields a qualitatively new regime in which an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations governs the evolution of the summary statistics. We develop a tractable reduction that reveals a three-phase trajectory: (i) fast escape from low alignment, (ii) slow convergence of the summary statistics, and (iii) spectral-tail learning in low-variance directions. From this decomposition, we derive explicit scaling laws for the mean-squared error, showing how spectral decay dictates convergence times and error curves. Experiments confirm the predicted phases and exponents. These results provide the first rigorous characterization of scaling laws in nonlinear regression with anisotropic data, highlighting how anisotropy reshapes learning dynamics.",human
"Corrupted training data are ubiquitous. Corrective Machine Unlearning (CMU) seeks to remove the influence of such corruption post-training. Prior CMU typically assumes access to identified corrupted training samples (a ""forget set""). However, in many real-world scenarios the training data are no longer accessible. We formalize source-free CMU, where the original training data are unavailable and, consequently, no forget set of identified corrupted training samples can be specified. Instead, we assume a small proxy (surrogate) set of corrupted samples that reflect the suspected corruption type without needing to be the original training samples. In this stricter setting, methods relying on forget set are ineffective or narrow in scope. We introduce Corrective Unlearning in Task Space (CUTS), a lightweight weight space correction method guided by the proxy set using task arithmetic principles. CUTS treats the clean and the corruption signal as distinct tasks. Specifically, we briefly fine-tune the corrupted model on the proxy to amplify the corruption mechanism in the weight space, compute the difference between the corrupted and fine-tuned weights as a proxy task vector, and subtract a calibrated multiple of this vector to cancel the corruption. Without access to clean data or a forget set, CUTS recovers a large fraction of the lost utility under label noise and, for backdoor triggers, nearly eliminates the attack with minimal damage to utility, outperforming state-of-the-art specialized CMU methods in source-free setting.",human
"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but still suffers from long contexts and disjoint retrieval-generation optimization. In this work, we propose CLaRa (Continuous Latent Reasoning), a unified framework that performs embedding-based compression and joint optimization in a shared continuous space. To obtain semantically rich and retrievable compressed vectors, we introduce SCP, a key-preserving data synthesis framework using QA and paraphrase supervision. CLaRa then trains the reranker and generator end-to-end via a single language modeling loss, with gradients flowing through both modules using a differentiable top-k estimator. Theoretically, this unified optimization aligns retrieval relevance with answer quality. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that CLaRa achieves state-of-the-art compression and reranking performance, often surpassing text-based fine-tuned baselines.",human
"Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise. Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These ""one-shot"" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.   We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.   We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than naïve search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.",human
"This paper introduces Lean 5.0, a human-centric evolution of Lean-Digital integration that connects predictive analytics, AI collaboration, and continuous learning within Industry 5.0 and Construction 5.0 contexts. A systematic literature review (2019-2024) and a 12-week empirical validation study demonstrate measurable performance gains, including a 13% increase in Plan Percent Complete (PPC), 22% reduction in rework, and 42% improvement in forecast accuracy. The study adopts a mixed-method Design Science Research (DSR) approach aligned with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The paper also examines integration with digital twin and blockchain technologies to improve traceability, auditability, and lifecycle transparency. Despite limitations related to sample size, single-case design, and study duration, the findings show that Lean 5.0 provides a transformative paradigm connecting human cognition with predictive control in construction management.",human
"This study systematically evaluated the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the 2026 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) Mathematics section, ensuring a completely contamination-free evaluation environment. To address data leakage issues in existing benchmarks, we digitized all 46 questions (22 common and 24 elective) within two hours of the exam's public release, eliminating any possibility of inclusion in model training data. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs across varying input modalities (text, image, text+figure) and prompt languages (Korean, English).   GPT-5 Codex achieved the only perfect score (100 points) with text input and Korean prompts, while Grok 4, GPT-5, and Deepseek R1 scored above 95 points. Notably, gpt-oss-20B achieved 95.7 points despite its relatively small size, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Problem-specific analysis revealed geometry as the weakest domain (77.7% average) with significant performance degradation on 4-point high-difficulty problems. Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale.   In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (from 82.6 to 100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a real-exam-based LLM assessment framework, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations. Detailed results and model comparisons are available at the 2026 Korean CSAT LLM Evaluation Leaderboard (https://isoft.cnu.ac.kr/csat2026/).",human
"The KV cache is a dominant memory bottleneck for LLM inference. While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget. We release the full implementation of Kitty at https://github.com/Summer-Summer/Kitty.",human
"Mental health disorders, particularly cognitive disorders defined by deficits in cognitive abilities, are described in detail in the DSM-5, which includes definitions and examples of signs and symptoms. A simplified, machine-actionable representation was developed to assess the similarity and separability of these disorders, but it is not suited for the most complex cases. Generating or applying a full binary matrix for similarity calculations is infeasible due to the vast number of symptom combinations. This research develops an alternative representation that links the narrative form of the DSM-5 with the binary matrix representation and enables automated generation of valid symptom combinations. Using a strict pre-defined format of lists, sets, and numbers with slight variations, complex diagnostic pathways involving numerous symptom combinations can be represented. This format, called the symptom profile generator (or simply generator), provides a readable, adaptable, and comprehensive alternative to a binary matrix while enabling easy generation of symptom combinations (profiles). Cognitive disorders, which typically involve multiple diagnostic criteria with several symptoms, can thus be expressed as lists of generators. Representing several psychotic disorders in generator form and generating all symptom combinations showed that matrix representations of complex disorders become too large to manage. The MPCS (maximum pairwise cosine similarity) algorithm cannot handle matrices of this size, prompting the development of a profile reduction method using targeted generator manipulation to find specific MPCS values between disorders. The generators allow easier creation of binary representations for large matrices and make it possible to calculate specific MPCS cases between complex disorders through conditional generators.",human
"Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit societal biases from their training data, potentially leading to harmful or unfair outputs. While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted. This work investigates the cross-category consequences of targeted bias mitigation. We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence. These findings underscore the critical need for robust, multi-dimensional evaluation tools when examining and developing bias mitigation strategies to avoid inadvertently shifting or worsening bias along untargeted axes.",human
"Machine learning models increasingly function as representational systems, yet the philosoph- ical assumptions underlying their internal structures remain largely unexamined. This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.",human
"Recent advances in large language models made it possible to achieve high conversational performance with substantially reduced computational demands, enabling practical on-site deployment in clinical environments. Such progress allows for local integration of AI systems that uphold strict data protection and patient privacy requirements, yet their secure implementation in medicine necessitates careful consideration of ethical, regulatory, and technical constraints.   In this study, we introduce MedChat, a locally deployable virtual physician framework that integrates an LLM-based medical chatbot with a diffusion-driven avatar for automated and structured anamnesis. The chatbot was fine-tuned using a hybrid corpus of real and synthetically generated medical dialogues, while model efficiency was optimized via Low-Rank Adaptation. A secure and isolated database interface was implemented to ensure complete separation between patient data and the inference process. The avatar component was realized through a conditional diffusion model operating in latent space, trained on researcher video datasets and synchronized with mel-frequency audio features for realistic speech and facial animation.   Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis. The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data. The proposed system thus provides a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient foundation for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, also in low-cost settings.",human
"Interdisciplinary scientific breakthroughs mostly emerge unexpectedly, and forecasting the formation of novel research fields remains a major challenge. We introduce FOS (Future Of Science), a comprehensive time-aware graph-based benchmark that reconstructs annual co-occurrence graphs of 65,027 research sub-fields (spanning 19 general domains) over the period 1827-2024. In these graphs, edges denote the co-occurrence of two fields in a single publication and are timestamped with the corresponding publication year. Nodes are enriched with semantic embeddings, and edges are characterized by temporal and topological descriptors. We formulate the prediction of new field-pair linkages as a temporal link-prediction task, emphasizing the ""first-time"" connections that signify pioneering interdisciplinary directions. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art temporal graph architectures under multiple negative-sampling regimes and show that (i) embedding long-form textual descriptions of fields significantly boosts prediction accuracy, and (ii) distinct model classes excel under different evaluation settings. Case analyses show that top-ranked link predictions on FOS align with field pairings that emerge in subsequent years of academic publications. We publicly release FOS, along with its temporal data splits and evaluation code, to establish a reproducible benchmark for advancing research in predicting scientific frontiers.",human
"Sampling multiple outputs from a Large Language Model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent (Self-consistency) or highest-scoring (Best-of-N) candidate is a popular approach to achieve higher accuracy in tasks with discrete final answers. Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms.",human
"Reliable detection of retinal diseases from fundus images is challenged by the variability in imaging quality, subtle early-stage manifestations, and domain shift across datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings.   On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data.

"We present OpenGloss, a synthetic encyclopedic dictionary and semantic knowledge graph for English that integrates lexicographic definitions, encyclopedic context, etymological histories, and semantic relationships in a unified resource. OpenGloss contains 537K senses across 150K lexemes, on par with WordNet 3.1 and Open English WordNet, while providing more than four times as many sense definitions. These lexemes include 9.1M semantic edges, 1M usage examples, 3M collocations, and 60M words of encyclopedic content.   Generated through a multi-agent procedural generation pipeline with schema-validated LLM outputs and automated quality assurance, the entire resource was produced in under one week for under $1,000. This demonstrates that structured generation can create comprehensive lexical resources at cost and time scales impractical for manual curation, enabling rapid iteration as foundation models improve. The resource addresses gaps in pedagogical applications by providing integrated content -- definitions, examples, collocations, encyclopedias, etymology -- that supports both vocabulary learning and natural language processing tasks.   As a synthetically generated resource, OpenGloss reflects both the capabilities and limitations of current foundation models. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face under CC-BY 4.0, enabling researchers and educators to build upon and adapt this resource.",human
"Language Models are extremely susceptible to performance collapse with even small changes to input prompt strings. Libraries such as DSpy (from Stanford NLP) avoid this problem through demonstration-based prompt optimisation. Inspired by this, I propose an alternative approach that treats prompt optimisation as a classical state-space search problem. I model the prompt space as a graph where nodes represent prompt states and edges correspond to deliberate transformations such as shortening, adding examples, or re- ordering content. Using beam search and random walk algorithms, I systematically explore this space, evaluating candidates on development sets and pruning unpromising branches. Across five NLP tasks (sentiment classification, question answering, summarisation, reason- ing, and natural language inference), I find that even shallow search configurations (beam width=2, depth=2) improve upon seed prompts on development sets. For instance, beam search achieves development accuracy gains from 0.40 to 0.80 on reasoning tasks, though test set improvements are more modest (0.20 to 0.50), indicating overfitting to the develop- ment heuristic. Analysis of successful optimisation paths reveals that transformations that make prompts concise appear most frequently, while verbosity operators are never selected. My results validate prompt optimization as a search problem and suggest that with greater computational resources and improved evaluation metrics, deeper exploration could yield more robust prompts that generalize beyond development sets. Code and implementation are available at [https://github.com/MaanasTaneja/PromptOptimiser].",human
"In our daily lives, newspapers are an essential information source that impacts how the public talks about present-day issues. However, effectively navigating the vast amount of news content from different newspapers and online news portals can be challenging. Newspaper headlines with sentiment analysis tell us what the news is about (e.g., politics, sports) and how the news makes us feel (positive, negative, neutral). This helps us quickly understand the emotional tone of the news. This research presents a state-of-the-art approach to Bangla news headline classification combined with sentiment analysis applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the hybrid transfer learning model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM. We have explored a dataset called BAN-ABSA of 9014 news headlines, which is the first time that has been experimented with simultaneously in the headline and sentiment categorization in Bengali newspapers. Over this imbalanced dataset, we applied two experimental strategies: technique-1, where undersampling and oversampling are applied before splitting, and technique-2, where undersampling and oversampling are applied after splitting on the In technique-1 oversampling provided the strongest performance, both headline and sentiment, that is 78.57\% and 73.43\% respectively, while technique-2 delivered the highest result when trained directly on the original imbalanced dataset, both headline and sentiment, that is 81.37\% and 64.46\% respectively. The proposed model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM significantly outperforms all baseline models in classification tasks, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for Bangla news headline classification and sentiment analysis. These results demonstrate the importance of leveraging both the headline and sentiment datasets, and provide a strong baseline for Bangla text classification in low-resource.",human
"Beliefs are central to how humans reason, communicate, and form social connections, yet most computational approaches to studying them remain confined to narrow sociopolitical contexts and rely on fine-tuning for optimal performance. Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) across disciplines, how well these systems generalize across diverse belief domains remains unclear. We introduce a systematic, reproducible benchmark that evaluates the ability of LLMs to predict individuals' stances on a wide range of topics in a zero-shot setting using data from an online debate platform. The benchmark includes multiple informational conditions that isolate the contribution of demographic context and known prior beliefs to predictive success. Across several small- to medium-sized models, we find that providing more background information about an individual improves predictive accuracy, but performance varies substantially across belief domains. These findings reveal both the capacity and limitations of current LLMs to emulate human reasoning, advancing the study of machine behavior and offering a scalable framework for modeling belief systems beyond the sociopolitical sphere.",human
"Label shift, a prevalent challenge in supervised learning, arises when the class prior distribution of test data differs from that of training data, leading to significant degradation in classifier performance. To accurately estimate the test priors and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a Bayesian framework for label shift estimation, termed Full Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (FMAPLS), along with its online version, online-FMAPLS. Leveraging batch and online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, these methods jointly and dynamically optimize Dirichlet hyperparameters $\boldsymbolα$ and class priors $\boldsymbolπ$, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of the existing Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (MAPLS) approach. Moreover, we introduce a linear surrogate function (LSF) to replace gradient-based hyperparameter updates, yielding closed-form solutions that reduce computational complexity while retaining asymptotic equivalence. The online variant substitutes the batch E-step with a stochastic approximation, enabling real-time adaptation to streaming data. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between online convergence rate and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets under shuffled long-tail and Dirichlet test priors demonstrate that FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS respectively achieve up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence and substantial improvements in post-shift accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance and distributional uncertainty. These results confirm the robustness, scalability, and suitability of the proposed methods for large-scale and dynamic learning scenarios.",human
"This paper compares Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) for forecasting non-deterministic stock price data, evaluating predictive accuracy versus interpretability trade-offs using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).LSTM demonstrates substantial superiority across all tested prediction horizons, confirming their established effectiveness for sequential data modelling. Standard KAN, while offering theoretical interpretability through the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, exhibits significantly higher error rates and limited practical applicability for time series forecasting. The results confirm LSTM dominance in accuracy-critical time series applications while identifying computational efficiency as KANs' primary advantage in resource-constrained scenarios where accuracy requirements are less stringent. The findings support LSTM adoption for practical financial forecasting while suggesting that continued research into specialised KAN architectures may yield future improvements.",human
"Split learning emerges as a promising paradigm for collaborative distributed model training, akin to federated learning, by partitioning neural networks between clients and a server without raw data exchange. However, sequential split learning suffers from poor scalability, while parallel variants like parallel split learning and split federated learning often incur high server resource overhead due to model duplication and aggregation, and generally exhibit reduced model performance and convergence owing to factors like client drift and lag. To address these limitations, we introduce CycleSL, a novel aggregation-free split learning framework that enhances scalability and performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods. Inspired by alternating block coordinate descent, CycleSL treats server-side training as an independent higher-level machine learning task, resampling client-extracted features (smashed data) to mitigate heterogeneity and drift. It then performs cyclical updates, namely optimizing the server model first, followed by client updates using the updated server for gradient computation. We integrate CycleSL into previous algorithms and benchmark them on five publicly available datasets with non-iid data distribution and partial client attendance. Our empirical findings highlight the effectiveness of CycleSL in enhancing model performance. Our source code is available at https://gitlab.lrz.de/hctl/CycleSL.",human
"Progress in understanding expert performance is limited by the scarcity of quantitative data on long-term knowledge acquisition and deployment. Here we use the Rubik's Cube as a cognitive model system existing at the intersection of puzzle solving, skill learning, expert knowledge, cultural transmission, and group theory. By studying competitive cube communities, we find evidence for universality in the collective learning of the Rubik's Cube in both sighted and blindfolded conditions: expert performance follows exponential progress curves whose parameters reflect the delayed acquisition of algorithms that shorten solution paths. Blindfold solves form a distinct problem class from sighted solves and are constrained not only by expert knowledge but also by the skill improvements required to overcome short-term memory bottlenecks, a constraint shared with blindfold chess. Cognitive artifacts such as the Rubik's Cube help solvers navigate an otherwise enormous mathematical state space. In doing so, they sustain collective intelligence by integrating communal knowledge stores with individual expertise and skill, illustrating how expertise can, in practice, continue to deepen over the course of a single lifetime.",human
"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used for aligning large language models, yet practitioners face a persistent puzzle: improving safety often reduces fairness, scaling to diverse populations becomes computationally intractable, and making systems robust often amplifies majority biases. We formalize this tension as the Alignment Trilemma: no RLHF system can simultaneously achieve (i) epsilon-representativeness across diverse human values, (ii) polynomial tractability in sample and compute complexity, and (iii) delta-robustness against adversarial perturbations and distribution shift. Through a complexity-theoretic analysis integrating statistical learning theory and robust optimization, we prove that achieving both representativeness (epsilon <= 0.01) and robustness (delta <= 0.001) for global-scale populations requires Omega(2^{d_context}) operations, which is super-polynomial in the context dimensionality. We show that current RLHF implementations resolve this trilemma by sacrificing representativeness: they collect only 10^3--10^4 samples from homogeneous annotator pools while 10^7--10^8 samples are needed for true global representation. Our framework provides a unified explanation for documented RLHF pathologies including preference collapse, sycophancy, and systematic bias amplification. We conclude with concrete directions for navigating these fundamental trade-offs through strategic relaxations of alignment requirements.",human
"Latent safety filters extend Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability to operate on latent state representations and dynamics learned directly from high-dimensional observations, enabling safe visuomotor control under hard-to-model constraints. However, existing methods implement ""least-restrictive"" filtering that discretely switch between nominal and safety policies, potentially undermining the task performance that makes modern visuomotor policies valuable. While reachability value functions can, in principle, be adapted to be control barrier functions (CBFs) for smooth optimization-based filtering, we theoretically and empirically show that current latent-space learning methods produce fundamentally incompatible value functions. We identify two sources of incompatibility: First, in HJ reachability, failures are encoded via a ""margin function"" in latent space, whose sign indicates whether or not a latent is in the constraint set. However, representing the margin function as a classifier yields saturated value functions that exhibit discontinuous jumps. We prove that the value function's Lipschitz constant scales linearly with the margin function's Lipschitz constant, revealing that smooth CBFs require smooth margins. Second, reinforcement learning (RL) approximations trained solely on safety policy data yield inaccurate value estimates for nominal policy actions, precisely where CBF filtering needs them. We propose the LatentCBF, which addresses both challenges through gradient penalties that lead to smooth margin functions without additional labeling, and a value-training procedure that mixes data from both nominal and safety policy distributions. Experiments on simulated benchmarks and hardware with a vision-based manipulation policy demonstrate that LatentCBF enables smooth safety filtering while doubling the task-completion rate over prior switching methods.",human
"This study informs the design of future multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) and multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) algorithms by guiding choices based on constraint classification for constraint-based search algorithms. We categorize constraints as conservative or aggressive and provide insights into their search behavior, focusing specifically on vanilla Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Conflict-Based Search with Priorities (CBSw/P). Under a hybrid grid-roadmap representation with varying resolution, we observe that aggressive (priority constraint) formulations tend to solve more instances as agent count or resolution increases, whereas conservative (motion constraint) formulations yield stronger solution quality when both succeed. Findings are synthesized in a decision flowchart, aiding users in selecting suitable constraints. Recommendations extend to Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), emphasizing the importance of considering topological features alongside problem, solution, and representation features.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language and code generation, and are increasingly deployed as automatic judges of model outputs and learning activities. Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy. Our findings connect to recent work on LLMs-as-judges and automatic difficulty estimation in programming and education, and highlight concrete failure modes that must be addressed before LLM-based judges can be considered trustworthy in competitive programming, educational platforms, or reinforcement-learning pipelines.",human
"Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.",human
"Integrated sensing and communication and millimeter wave (mmWave) have emerged as pivotal technologies for 6G networks. However, the narrow nature of mmWave beams requires precise alignments that typically necessitate large training overhead. This overhead can be reduced by incorporating the position information with beam adjustments. This letter proposes a lightweight autorencoder (LAE) model that addresses the position-assisted beam prediction problem while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to the conventional baseline method, i.e., deep fully connected neural network. The proposed LAE is designed as a three-layer undercomplete network to exploit its dimensionality reduction capabilities and thereby mitigate the computational requirements of the trained model. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves a similar beam prediction accuracy to the baseline with an 83% complexity reduction.",human
"Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs) optimize for statistical likelihood, implicitly acting as \textbf{frequency filters} that favor abundant substructures over spectrally critical ones. We term this phenomenon \textbf{Generative Myopia}. In combinatorial tasks like graph sparsification, this leads to the catastrophic removal of ``rare bridges,'' edges that are structurally mandatory ($R_{\text{eff}} \approx 1$) but statistically scarce. We prove theoretically and empirically that this failure is driven by \textbf{Gradient Starvation}: the optimization landscape itself suppresses rare structural signals, rendering them unlearnable regardless of model capacity. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{Spectrally-Weighted Diffusion}, which re-aligns the variational objective using Effective Resistance. We demonstrate that spectral priors can be amortized into the training phase with zero inference overhead. Our method eliminates myopia, matching the performance of an optimal Spectral Oracle and achieving \textbf{100\% connectivity} on adversarial benchmarks where standard diffusion fails completely (0\%).",human
"Large photometric surveys will image billions of galaxies, but we currently lack quick, reliable automated ways to infer their physical properties like morphology, stellar mass, and star formation rates. Simulations provide galaxy images with ground-truth physical labels, but domain shifts in PSF, noise, backgrounds, selection, and label priors degrade transfer to real surveys. We present a preliminary domain adaptation pipeline that trains on simulated TNG50 galaxies and evaluates on real SDSS galaxies with morphology labels (elliptical/spiral/irregular). We train three backbones (CNN, $E(2)$-steerable CNN, ResNet-18) with focal loss and effective-number class weighting, and a feature-level domain loss $L_D$ built from GeomLoss (entropic Sinkhorn OT, energy distance, Gaussian MMD, and related metrics). We show that a combination of these losses with an OT-based ""top_$k$ soft matching"" loss that focuses $L_D$ on the worst-matched source-target pairs can further enhance domain alignment. With Euclidean distance, scheduled alignment weights, and top-$k$ matching, target accuracy (macro F1) rises from $\sim$46% ($\sim$30%) at no adaptation to $\sim$87% ($\sim$62.6%), with a domain AUC near 0.5, indicating strong latent-space mixing.",human
"Organizations are rapidly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform their operations, yet they lack clear guidance on key decisions for adoption and implementation. While LLMs offer powerful capabilities in content generation, assisted coding, and process automation, businesses face critical challenges in data security, LLM solution development approach, infrastructure requirements, and deployment strategies. Healthcare providers must protect patient data while leveraging LLMs for medical analysis, financial institutions need to balance automated customer service with regulatory compliance, and software companies seek to enhance development productivity while maintaining code security.   This article presents a systematic six-step decision framework for LLM adoption, helping organizations navigate from initial application selection to final deployment. Based on extensive interviews and analysis of successful and failed implementations, our framework provides practical guidance for business leaders to align technological capabilities with business objectives. Through key decision points and real-world examples from both B2B and B2C contexts, organizations can make informed decisions about LLM adoption while ensuring secure and efficient integration across various use cases, from customer service automation to content creation and advanced analytics.",human
"Dependent data underlies many statistical studies in the social and health sciences, which often involve sensitive or private information. Differential privacy (DP) and in particular \textit{user-level} DP provide a natural formalization of privacy requirements for processing dependent data where each individual provides multiple observations to the dataset. However, dependence introduced, e.g., through repeated measurements challenges the existing statistical theory under DP-constraints. In \iid{} settings, noisy Winsorized mean estimators have been shown to be minimax optimal for standard (\textit{item-level}) and \textit{user-level} DP estimation of a mean $μ\in \R^d$. Yet, their behavior on potentially dependent observations has not previously been studied. We fill this gap and show that Winsorized mean estimators can also be used under dependence for bounded and unbounded data, and can lead to asymptotic and finite sample guarantees that resemble their \iid{} counterparts under a weak notion of dependence. For this, we formalize dependence via log-Sobolev inequalities on the joint distribution of observations. This enables us to adapt the stable histogram by Karwa and Vadhan (2018) to a non-\iid{} setting, which we then use to estimate the private projection intervals of the Winsorized estimator. The resulting guarantees for our item-level mean estimator extend to \textit{user-level} mean estimation and transfer to the local model via a randomized response histogram. Using the mean estimators as building blocks, we provide extensions to random effects models, longitudinal linear regression and nonparametric regression. Therefore, our work constitutes a first step towards a systematic study of DP for dependent data.",human
"Concerns about how workers are perceived can deter effective collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI). In a field experiment on a large online labor market, I hired 450 U.S.-based remote workers to complete an image-categorization job assisted by AI recommendations. Workers were incentivized by the prospect of a contract extension based on an HR evaluator's feedback. I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate. Leveraging the platform's public feedback feature, I introduce a novel incentive-compatible elicitation method showing that workers fear heavy reliance on AI signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a trait they view as essential when collaborating with AI.",human
"Financial time series forecasting is central to trading, portfolio optimization, and risk management, yet it remains challenging due to noisy, non-stationary, and heterogeneous data. Recent advances in time series foundation models (TSFMs), inspired by large language models, offer a new paradigm for learning generalizable temporal representations from large and diverse datasets. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation. Increasing the dataset size, incorporating synthetic data augmentation, and applying hyperparameter tuning further enhance performance.",human
"Long-sequence electroencephalogram (EEG) modeling is essential for developing generalizable EEG representation models. This need arises from the high sampling rate of EEG data and the long recording durations required to capture extended neurological patterns in brain activity. Transformer-based models have shown promise in modeling short sequences of a few seconds; however, their quadratic complexity limits scalability to longer contexts. Moreover, variability in electrode montage across available datasets, along with inter-subject differences in brain signals, pose significant challenges to developing a generalizable and robust foundation model. We propose \textit{SAMBA}, a self-supervised learning framework with a Mamba-based U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, which effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and spatial variability in EEG data. Leveraging the inherent ability of Mamba in processing long context sizes, we introduce: (1) \textit{Temporal Semantic Random Masking} for semantic-level sequence reconstruction, (2) a \textit{Multi-Head Differential Mamba} module to suppress redundancy and emphasize salient temporal structures, and (3) a \textit{Spatial-Adaptive Input Embedding} that learns unified embeddings in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling robustness across devices. Experiments on thirteen EEG datasets across diverse tasks, electrode configurations, and sequence durations demonstrate that SAMBA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low memory consumption and inference time. We also show the learned spatial weight maps from our embedding module align closely with task-relevant neurophysiological regions, demonstrating the learnability and interpretability of SAMBA. These results highlight SAMBA's scalability and practical potential as a foundation model for real-time brain-computer interface applications.",human
"The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, enabling neural networks to learn through local updates. However, FF's efficacy relies heavily on the definition of ""goodness"", which is a scalar measure of neural activity. While current implementations predominantly utilize a simple sum-of-squares metric, it remains unclear if this default choice is optimal. To address this, we benchmarked 21 distinct goodness functions across four standard image datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10), evaluating classification accuracy, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. We found that certain alternative goodness functions inspired from various domains significantly outperform the standard baseline. Specifically, \texttt{game\_theoretic\_local} achieved 97.15\% accuracy on MNIST, \texttt{softmax\_energy\_margin\_local} reached 82.84\% on FashionMNIST, and \texttt{triplet\_margin\_local} attained 37.69\% on STL-10. Furthermore, we observed substantial variability in computational efficiency, highlighting a critical trade-off between predictive performance and environmental cost. These findings demonstrate that the goodness function is a pivotal hyperparameter in FF design. We release our code on \href{https://github.com/aryashah2k/In-Search-of-Goodness}{Github} for reference and reproducibility.",human
"Conformal prediction (CP) provides distribution-free, finite-sample coverage guarantees but critically relies on exchangeability, a condition often violated under distribution shift. We study the robustness of split conformal prediction under adversarial perturbations at test time, focusing on both coverage validity and the resulting prediction set size. Our theoretical analysis characterizes how the strength of adversarial perturbations during calibration affects coverage guarantees under adversarial test conditions. We further examine the impact of adversarial training at the model-training stage. Extensive experiments support our theory: (i) Prediction coverage varies monotonically with the calibration-time attack strength, enabling the use of nonzero calibration-time attack to predictably control coverage under adversarial tests; (ii) target coverage can hold over a range of test-time attacks: with a suitable calibration attack, coverage stays within any chosen tolerance band across a contiguous set of perturbation levels; and (iii) adversarial training at the training stage produces tighter prediction sets that retain high informativeness.",human
"Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches.

Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata.

"We develop an all-at-once modeling framework for learning systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) from scarce, partial, and noisy observations of the states. The proposed methodology amounts to a combination of sparse recovery strategies for the ODE over a function library combined with techniques from reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory for estimating the state and discretizing the ODE. Our numerical experiments reveal that the proposed strategy leads to significant gains in terms of accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness to noise, both in terms of learning the equation and estimating the unknown states. This work demonstrates capabilities well beyond existing and widely used algorithms while extending the modeling flexibility of other recent developments in equation discovery.",human
"We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time steps before a demand-specific deadline $Δ_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to the constraints above) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm called $\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting \& aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\texttt{PAAD}$.",human
"Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting (PTSF) is critical for uncertainty-aware decision making, but existing generative models, such as diffusion-based approaches, are computationally prohibitive due to expensive iterative sampling. Non-sampling frameworks like Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) offer an efficient alternative, but suffer from severe training instability and hypothesis collapse, which has historically hindered their performance. This problem is dramatically exacerbated when attempting to combine them with modern, efficient MLP-based backbones. To resolve this fundamental incompatibility, we propose TimePre, a novel framework that successfully unifies the efficiency of MLP-based models with the distributional flexibility of the MCL paradigm. The core of our solution is Stabilized Instance Normalization (SIN), a novel normalization layer that explicitly remedies this incompatibility. SIN stabilizes the hybrid architecture by correcting channel-wise statistical shifts, definitively resolving the catastrophic hypothesis collapse. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimePre achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on key probabilistic metrics. Critically, TimePre achieves inference speeds orders of magnitude faster than sampling-based models and, unlike prior MCL work, demonstrates stable performance scaling. It thus bridges the long-standing gap between accuracy, efficiency, and stability in probabilistic forecasting.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic).

"We propose a way of transforming the problem of conditional density estimation into a single nonparametric regression task via the introduction of auxiliary samples. This allows leveraging regression methods that work well in high dimensions, such as neural networks and decision trees. Our main theoretical result characterizes and establishes the convergence of our estimator to the true conditional density in the data limit. We develop condensité, a method that implements this approach. We demonstrate the benefit of the auxiliary samples on synthetic data and showcase that condensité can achieve good out-of-the-box results. We evaluate our method on a large population survey dataset and on a satellite imaging dataset. In both cases, we find that condensité matches or outperforms the state of the art and yields conditional densities in line with established findings in the literature on each dataset. Our contribution opens up new possibilities for regression-based conditional density estimation and the empirical results indicate strong promise for applied research.",human
"Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials offer a promising path toward sustainable energy generation, but their development is limited by the difficulty of identifying high performance donor and acceptor pairs with strong power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Existing design strategies typically focus on either the donor or the acceptor alone, rather than using a unified approach capable of modeling both components. In this work, we introduce a dual machine learning framework for OPV discovery that combines predictive modeling with generative molecular design. We present the Organic Photovoltaic Donor Acceptor Dataset (OPV2D), the largest curated dataset of its kind, containing 2000 experimentally characterized donor acceptor pairs. Using this dataset, we develop the Organic Photovoltaic Classifier (OPVC) to predict whether a material exhibits OPV behavior, and a hierarchical graph neural network that incorporates multi task learning and donor acceptor interaction modeling. This framework includes the Molecular Orbital Energy Estimator (MOE2) for predicting HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the Photovoltaic Performance Predictor (P3) for estimating PCE. In addition, we introduce the Material Generative Pretrained Transformer (MatGPT) to produce synthetically accessible organic semiconductors, guided by a reinforcement learning strategy with three objective policy optimization. By linking molecular representation learning with performance prediction, our framework advances data driven discovery of high performance OPV materials.",human
"Geostationary hyperspectral satellites generate terabytes of data daily, creating critical challenges for storage, transmission, and distribution to the scientific community. We present a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that achieves x514 compression of NASA's TEMPO satellite hyperspectral observations (1028 channels, 290-490nm) with reconstruction errors 1-2 orders of magnitude below the signal across all wavelengths. This dramatic data volume reduction enables efficient archival and sharing of satellite observations while preserving spectral fidelity. Beyond compression, we investigate to what extent atmospheric information is retained in the compressed latent space by training linear and nonlinear probes to extract Level-2 products (NO2, O3, HCHO, cloud fraction). Cloud fraction and total ozone achieve strong extraction performance (R^2 = 0.93 and 0.81 respectively), though these represent relatively straightforward retrievals given their distinct spectral signatures. In contrast, tropospheric trace gases pose genuine challenges for extraction (NO2 R^2 = 0.20, HCHO R^2 = 0.51) reflecting their weaker signals and complex atmospheric interactions. Critically, we find the VAE encodes atmospheric information in a semi-linear manner - nonlinear probes substantially outperform linear ones - and that explicit latent supervision during training provides minimal improvement, revealing fundamental encoding challenges for certain products. This work demonstrates that neural compression can dramatically reduce hyperspectral data volumes while preserving key atmospheric signals, addressing a critical bottleneck for next-generation Earth observation systems.

"Adapting CLIP to vertical domains is typically approached by novel fine-tuning strategies or by continual pre-training (CPT) on large domain-specific datasets. Yet, data itself remains an underexplored factor in this process. We revisit this task from a data-centric perspective: Can effective data selection substitute for large-scale datasets in CPT? We introduce CHIPS (Curvature-aware Hybrid Influence in Projection Subspace), which assigns each image-text pair a utility score that integrates three complementary factors aligned with three goals: faithfulness via a curvature-aware, Newton-style alignment computed in CLIP's end-point subspace; scalability via an InfoNCE-aware curvature estimator with Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) sketching; and retention via a selection-aware relevance weight combined with learnability to balance target adaptation against general-domain preservation. We justify this design theoretically by proving a lower-bound guarantee on the proxy's correlation with full-parameter alignment and by characterizing the bias-variance trade-offs introduced by curvature mixing and JL sketching. We evaluate CHIPS empirically across various settings: 1) CHIPS attains state-of-the-art performance among selection baselines on 17 medical benchmarks, matches full-dataset CPT with 30% of the data, and outperforms half-dataset CPT using only 10%; 2) on 31 general-domain benchmarks, CHIPS yields the smallest performance drop under 10-30% data-retention budgets. Code, data, and checkpoints will be released.",human
"Within the limited scope of this paper, we argue that artificial general intelligence cannot emerge from current neural network paradigms regardless of scale, nor is such an approach healthy for the field at present. Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and Gödelian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities. We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outline principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require, and furthermore, a conceptual method of structuralizing the richer framework on which the principle of neural network system takes hold.",human
"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) typically minimize average residuals, which can conceal large, localized errors. We propose Residual Risk-Aware Physics-Informed Neural Networks PINNs (RRaPINNs), a single-network framework that optimizes tail-focused objectives using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), we also introduced a Mean-Excess (ME) surrogate penalty to directly control worst-case PDE residuals. This casts PINN training as risk-sensitive optimization and links it to chance-constrained formulations. The method is effective and simple to implement. Across several partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Burgers, Heat, Korteweg-de-Vries, and Poisson (including a Poisson interface problem with a source jump at x=0.5) equations, RRaPINNs reduce tail residuals while maintaining or improving mean errors compared to vanilla PINNs, Residual-Based Attention and its variant using convolution weighting; the ME surrogate yields smoother optimization than a direct CVaR hinge. The chance constraint reliability level $α$ acts as a transparent knob trading bulk accuracy (lower $α$ ) for stricter tail control (higher $α$ ). We discuss the framework limitations, including memoryless sampling, global-only tail budgeting, and residual-centric risk, and outline remedies via persistent hard-point replay, local risk budgets, and multi-objective risk over BC/IC terms. RRaPINNs offer a practical path to reliability-aware scientific ML for both smooth and discontinuous PDEs.",human
"The rapid advancement of generators (e.g., StyleGAN, Midjourney, DALL-E) has produced highly realistic synthetic images, posing significant challenges to digital media authenticity. These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the ""fake"" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.",human
"Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.",human
"This position paper argues that literary scholars must engage with large language model (LLM) interpretability research. While doing so will involve ideological struggle, if not out-right complicity, the necessity of this engagement is clear: the abiding instrumentality of current approaches to interpretability cannot be the only standard by which we measure interpretation with LLMs. One site at which this struggle could take place, I suggest, is the red team.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but pose substantial privacy risks due to training data memorization, particularly within healthcare contexts involving imperfect or privacy-sensitive patient information. We present a hierarchical dual-strategy framework for selective knowledge unlearning that precisely removes specialized knowledge while preserving fundamental medical competencies. Our approach synergistically integrates geometric-constrained gradient updates to selectively modulate target parameters with concept-aware token-level interventions that distinguish between preservation-critical and unlearning-targeted tokens via a unified four-level medical concept hierarchy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MedMCQA (surgical) and MHQA (anxiety, depression, trauma) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving an 82.7% forgetting rate and 88.5% knowledge preservation. Notably, our framework maintains robust privacy guarantees while requiring modification of only 0.1% of parameters, addressing critical needs for regulatory compliance, auditability, and ethical standards in clinical research.",human
"The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.",human
"Demand for mental health support through AI chatbots is surging, though current systems present several limitations, like sycophancy or overvalidation, and reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs. A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments. Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication. Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms. We release all code, prompts, and human evaluation data.",human
"Our study presents a multifaceted approach to enhancing user interaction and content relevance in social media platforms through a federated learning framework. We introduce personalized LLM Federated Learning and Context-based Social Media models. In our framework, multiple client entities receive a foundational GPT model, which is fine-tuned using locally collected social media data while ensuring data privacy through federated aggregation. Key modules focus on categorizing user-generated content, computing user persona scores, and identifying relevant posts from friends networks. By integrating a sophisticated social engagement quantification method with matrix factorization techniques, our system delivers real-time personalized content suggestions tailored to individual preferences. Furthermore, an adaptive feedback loop, alongside a robust readability scoring algorithm, significantly enhances the quality and relevance of the content presented to users. This comprehensive solution not only addresses the challenges of content filtering and recommendation but also fosters a more engaging social media experience while safeguarding user privacy, setting a new standard for personalized interactions in digital platforms.",human
"Systems incorporating large language models (LLMs) as a component are known to be sensitive (i.e., non-robust) to minor input variations that do not change the meaning of the input; such sensitivity may reduce the system's usefulness. Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.",human
"Text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-music (TTM) models face significant limitations in instruction-based control. TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation.

"The attention mechanism has demonstrated remarkable potential in sequence modeling, exemplified by its successful application in natural language processing with models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Despite these advancements, its utilization in time series forecasting (TSF) has yet to meet expectations. Exploring a better network structure for attention in TSF holds immense significance across various domains. In this paper, we present PeriodNet with a brand new structure to forecast univariate and multivariate time series. PeriodNet incorporates period attention and sparse period attention mechanism for analyzing adjacent periods. It enhances the mining of local characteristics, periodic patterns, and global dependencies. For efficient cross-variable modeling, we introduce an iterative grouping mechanism which can directly reduce the cross-variable redundancy. To fully leverage the extracted features on the encoder side, we redesign the entire architecture of the vanilla Transformer and propose a period diffuser for precise multi-period prediction. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on eight datasets, we demonstrate that PeriodNet outperforms six state-of-the-art models in both univariate and multivariate TSF scenarios in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error. In particular, PeriodNet achieves a relative improvement of 22% when forecasting time series with a length of 720, in comparison to other models based on the conventional encoder-decoder Transformer architecture.",human
"Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.",human
"Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is crucial for deploying models in real-world applications with unseen, evolving target domains. Existing CTTA methods, however, often rely on source data or prototypes, limiting their applicability in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings. Additionally, these methods suffer from long-term forgetting, which degrades performance on previously encountered domains as target domains shift. To address these challenges, we propose SloMo-Fast, a source-free, dual-teacher CTTA framework designed for enhanced adaptability and generalization. It includes two complementary teachers: the Slow-Teacher, which exhibits slow forgetting and retains long-term knowledge of previously encountered domains to ensure robust generalization, and the Fast-Teacher rapidly adapts to new domains while accumulating and integrating knowledge across them. This framework preserves knowledge of past domains and adapts efficiently to new ones. We also introduce Cyclic Test-Time Adaptation (Cyclic-TTA), a novel CTTA benchmark that simulates recurring domain shifts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SloMo-Fast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Cyclic-TTA, as well as ten other CTTA settings, highlighting its ability to both adapt and generalize across evolving and revisited domains.",human
"The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems has significantly streamlined software developing tasks, enabling users with little technical expertise to develop executable applications. While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.",human
"We study the problem of selecting the best heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimator from a collection of candidates in settings where the treatment effect is fundamentally unobserved. We cast estimator selection as a multiple testing problem and introduce a ground-truth-free procedure based on a cross-fitted, exponentially weighted test statistic. A key component of our method is a two-way sample splitting scheme that decouples nuisance estimation from weight learning and ensures the stability required for valid inference. Leveraging a stability-based central limit theorem, we establish asymptotic familywise error rate control under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, our procedure provides reliable error control while substantially reducing false selections compared with commonly used methods across ACIC 2016, IHDP, and Twins benchmarks, demonstrating that our method is feasible and powerful even without ground-truth treatment effects.",human
"We study an ultrasound-first, radiation-preserving policy for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) that requests a radiograph only when needed.   We (i) pretrain modality-specific encoders (ResNet-18) with SimSiam on a large unlabelled registry (37186 ultrasound; 19546 radiographs), (ii) freeze the backbones and fit small, measurement-faithful heads on DDH relevant landmarks and measurements (iii) calibrate a one sided conformal deferral rule on ultrasound predictions that provides finite sample coverage guarantees under exchangeability, using a held-out calibration set. Ultrasound heads predict Graf alpha, beta, and femoral head coverage; X-ray heads predict acetabular index (AI), center-edge (CE) angle and IHDI grade. On our held out labeled evaluation set, ultrasound measurement error is modest (e.g., alpha MAE ~= 9.7 degrees, coverage MAE ~= 14.0%), while radiographic probes achieve AI and CE MAEs of ~= 7.6 degrees and ~= 8.9 degrees, respectively. The calibrated US-only policy is explored across rule families (alpha-only; alpha OR coverage; alpha AND coverage), uncertainty inflation factors, and per-utility trade-offs using decision-curve analysis. Conservative settings yield high coverage with near-zero US-only rates; permissive settings (e.g., alpha OR coverage at larger deltas) achieve non-zero US-only throughput with expected coverage tradeoffs. The result is a simple, reproducible pipeline that turns limited labels into interpretable measurements and tunable selective imaging curves suitable for clinical handoff and future external validation.",human
"The degree of embryo fragmentation serves as a critical morphological indicator for assessing embryo developmental potential in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinical decision-making. However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of ""Gradient Conflict"" and ""Negative Transfer"" in multi-task training, we propose a ""Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy."" Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed ""Feature Injection"" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a ""Range Loss"" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning. This study ultimately presents a dual-module clinical auxiliary solution that combines high accuracy with visual explainability.",human
"Spatial reasoning is a key capability in the field of artificial intelligence, especially crucial in areas such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language understanding. However, evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models(MLLMs) in complex spatial reasoning still faces challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and precise mathematical constraints. This paper introduces ORIGAMISPACE, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-step spatial reasoning ability and the capacity to handle mathematical constraints of MLLMs through origami tasks. The dataset contains 350 data instances,each comprising a strictly formatted crease pattern (CP diagram), the Compiled Flat Pattern, the complete Folding Process, and the final Folded Shape Image. We propose four evaluation tasks: Pattern Prediction, Multi-step Spatial Reasoning, Spatial Relationship Prediction, and End-to-End CP Code Generation. For the CP code generation task, we design an interactive environment and explore the possibility of using reinforcement learning methods to train MLLMs. Through experiments on existing MLLMs, we initially reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these models in handling complex spatial reasoning tasks.",human
"The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources, making model compression essential for efficient deployment in constrained environments. Among the dominant compression techniques: knowledge distillation, structured pruning, and low-bit quantization, their individual effects are well studied, but their interactions and optimal sequencing remain unclear. This work systematically examines how these techniques perform both independently and in combination when applied to the Qwen2.5 3B model. We evaluate multiple compression pipelines, including single, and proposed three-technique sequences, using perplexity, G-Eval, clarity, prompt alignment, and compression ratio as metrics. Our experiments show that quantization provides the greatest standalone compression, while pruning introduces moderate quality degradation. Critically, the ordering of techniques significantly affects the final model quality: the sequence Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, Quantization (P-KD-Q) yields the best balance, achieving a 3.68x compression ratio while preserving strong instruction-following and language understanding capabilities. Conversely, pipelines applying quantization early suffer severe performance degradation due to irreversible information loss that impairs subsequent training. Overall, this study offers practical insight into designing effective, ordering-aware compression pipelines for deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings.",human
"Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of ""\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}"" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.",human
"Precise 3D segmentation of cerebral vasculature from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE) MRI is crucial for safe neurosurgical planning. Manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while current automated methods often trade accuracy for computational cost, limiting clinical use. We present NeuroVascU-Net, the first deep learning architecture specifically designed to segment cerebrovascular structures directly from clinically standard T1CE MRI in neuro-oncology patients, addressing a gap in prior work dominated by TOF-MRA-based approaches. NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures. Notably, it requires only 12.4M parameters, significantly fewer than transformer-based models such as Swin U-NetR. This balance of accuracy and efficiency positions NeuroVascU-Net as a practical solution for computer-assisted neurosurgical planning.",human
"Audio classifiers frequently face domain shift, when models trained on one dataset lose accuracy on data recorded in acoustically different conditions. Previous Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) research in speech and sound analysis often evaluates models under fixed or mismatched noise settings, that fail to mimic real-world variability. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents DHAuDS (Dynamic and Heterogeneous Audio Domain Shift), a benchmark designed to assess TTA approaches under more realistic and diverse acoustic shifts. DHAuDS comprises four standardized benchmarks: UrbanSound8K-C, SpeechCommandsV2-C, VocalSound-C, and ReefSet-C, each constructed with dynamic corruption severity levels and heterogeneous noise types to simulate authentic audio degradation scenarios. The framework defines 14 evaluation criteria for each benchmark (8 for UrbanSound8K-C), resulting in 50 unrepeated criteria (124 experiments) that collectively enable fair, reproducible, and cross-domain comparison of TTA algorithms. Through the inclusion of dynamic and mixed-domain noise settings, DHAuDS offers a consistent and publicly reproducible testbed to support ongoing studies in robust and adaptive audio modeling.",human
"We develop a theory of category-equivariant neural networks (CENNs) that unifies group/groupoid-equivariant networks, poset/lattice-equivariant networks, graph and sheaf neural networks. Equivariance is formulated as naturality in a topological category with Radon measures, formulating linear and nonlinear layers in the categorical setup. We prove the equivariant universal approximation theorem in the general setting: the class of finite-depth CENNs is dense in the space of continuous equivariant transformations. We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries.",human
"RFX (Random Forests X), where X stands for compression or quantization, presents a production-ready implementation of Breiman and Cutler's Random Forest classification methodology in Python. RFX v1.0 provides complete classification: out-of-bag error estimation, overall and local importance measures, proximity matrices with QLORA compression, case-wise analysis, and interactive visualization (rfviz)--all with CPU and GPU acceleration. Regression, unsupervised learning, CLIQUE importance, and RF-GAP proximity are planned for v2.0.   This work introduces four solutions addressing the proximity matrix memory bottleneck limiting Random Forest analysis to ~60,000 samples: (1) QLORA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) compression for GPU proximity matrices, reducing memory from 80GB to 6.4MB for 100k samples (12,500x compression with INT8 quantization) while maintaining 99% geometric structure preservation, (2) CPU TriBlock proximity--combining upper-triangle storage with block-sparse thresholding--achieving 2.7x memory reduction with lossless quality, (3) SM-aware GPU batch sizing achieving 95% GPU utilization, and (4) GPU-accelerated 3D MDS visualization computing embeddings directly from low-rank factors using power iteration.   Validation across four implementation modes (GPU/CPU x case-wise/non-case-wise) demonstrates correct implementation. GPU achieves 1.4x speedup over CPU for overall importance with 500+ trees. Proximity computation scales from 1,000 to 200,000+ samples (requiring GPU QLORA), with CPU TriBlock filling the gap for medium-scale datasets (10K-50K samples). RFX v1.0 eliminates the proximity memory bottleneck, enabling proximity-based Random Forest analysis on datasets orders of magnitude larger than previously feasible.

"Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.",human
"Although the community has tackled the acquisition of high-quality Arabic pretraining data, we still lack large-scale, multi-turn Arabic datasets that include reasoning and tool calling. Naive translation can work at the pretraining scale, but post-training demands much higher quality, which requires a stricter approach to dataset curation. In this work, we introduce SmolKalam, a translation of Smoltalk2 that uses a multi-model ensemble translation pipeline, applies quality filtering, and examines effective translation techniques for traditional decoder-only models through ablations.",human
"Mechanistic interpretability (MI) seeks to uncover how language models (LMs) implement specific behaviors, yet measuring progress in MI remains challenging. The recently released Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB; Mueller et al., 2025) provides a standardized framework for evaluating circuit and causal variable localization. Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery. With one team spanning two methods, participants achieved significant gains in causal variable localization using low-dimensional and non-linear projections to featurize activation vectors. The MIB leaderboard remains open; we encourage continued work in this standard evaluation framework to measure progress in MI research going forward.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.",human
"Recent pre-training strategies for molecular graphs have attempted to use 2D and 3D molecular views as both inputs and self-supervised signals, primarily aligning graph-level representations. However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.",human
"We show that when large language models learn to reward hack on production RL environments, this can result in egregious emergent misalignment. We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments. Unsurprisingly, the model learns to reward hack. Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks. Three mitigations are effective: (i) preventing the model from reward hacking; (ii) increasing the diversity of RLHF safety training; and (iii) ""inoculation prompting"", wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training removes misaligned generalization even when reward hacking is learned.",human
"METR's time horizon metric has grown exponentially since 2019, along with compute. However, it is unclear whether compute scaling will persist at current rates through 2030, raising the question of how possible compute slowdowns might impact AI agent capability forecasts. Given a model of time horizon as a function of training compute and algorithms, along with a model of how compute investment spills into algorithmic progress (which, notably, precludes the possibility of a software-only singularity), and the empirical fact that both time horizon and compute have grown at constant rates over 2019--2025, we derive that time horizon growth must be proportional to compute growth. We provide additional, albeit limited, experimental evidence consistent with this theory. We use our model to project time horizon growth under OpenAI's compute projection, finding substantial projected delays in some cases. For example, 1-month time horizons at $80\%$ reliability occur $7$ years later than simple trend extrapolation suggests.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate partial forecasting competence across social, political, and economic events. Yet, their predictive ability varies sharply with domain structure and prompt framing. We investigate how forecasting performance varies with different model families on real-world questions about events that happened beyond the model cutoff date. We analyze how context, question type, and external knowledge affect accuracy and calibration, and how adding factual news context modifies belief formation and failure modes. Our results show that forecasting ability is highly variable as it depends on what, and how, we ask.",human
"A decade of rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for clinical decision support systems (CDSS), with large language models (LLMs) demonstrating strong reasoning abilities on timely medical tasks. However, clinical texts are often degraded by human errors or failures in automated pipelines, raising concerns about the reliability and fairness of AI-assisted decision-making. Yet the impact of such degradations remains under-investigated, particularly regarding how noise-induced shifts can heighten predictive uncertainty and unevenly affect demographic subgroups. We present a systematic study of state-of-the-art LLMs under diverse text corruption scenarios, focusing on robustness and equity in next-visit diagnosis prediction. To address the challenge posed by the large diagnostic label space, we introduce a clinically grounded label-reduction scheme and a hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy that emulates clinicians' reasoning. Our approach improves robustness and reduces subgroup instability under degraded inputs, advancing the reliable use of LLMs in CDSS. We release code at https://github.com/heejkoo9/NECHOv3.",human
"Open-world machine learning is an emerging technique in artificial intelligence, where conventional machine learning models often follow closed-world assumptions, which can hinder their ability to retain previously learned knowledge for future tasks. However, automated intelligence systems must learn about novel classes and previously known tasks. The proposed model offers novel learning classes in an open and continuous learning environment. It consists of two different but connected tasks. First, it discovers unknown classes in the data and creates novel classes; next, it learns how to perform class incrementally for each new class. Together, they enable continual learning, allowing the system to expand its understanding of the data and improve over time. The proposed model also outperformed existing approaches in open-world learning. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong performance in continuous learning, achieving a highest average accuracy of 82.54% over four iterations and a minimum accuracy of 65.87%.",human
"Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, 3D shapes, signed distance fields, and radiance fields. While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability. Extensive experiments across image fitting, shape reconstruction, and neural radiance field approximation demonstrate that HC-INR achieves up to 4 times higher reconstruction fidelity than strong INR baselines while using 30--60\% fewer parameters.",human
"Automatic X-ray prohibited items detection is vital for security inspection and has been widely studied. Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a ""language-like modality"". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection.",human
"Deep autoencoder (DAE) frameworks have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting. Simulation results show that the proposed approach enhances the generalization capability of the DAE framework while maintaining low memory overhead. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated with other advanced CSI feedback models, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.",human
"Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, audio, and 3D scenes. However, existing INR frameworks -- including MLPs with Fourier features, SIREN, and multiresolution hash grids -- implicitly assume a \textit{global and stationary} spectral basis. This assumption is fundamentally misaligned with real-world signals whose frequency characteristics vary significantly across space, exhibiting local high-frequency textures, smooth regions, and frequency drift phenomena. We propose \textbf{Neural Spectral Transport Representation (NSTR)}, the first INR framework that \textbf{explicitly models a spatially varying local frequency field}. NSTR introduces a learnable \emph{frequency transport equation}, a PDE that governs how local spectral compositions evolve across space. Given a learnable local spectrum field $S(x)$ and a frequency transport network $F_θ$ enforcing $\nabla S(x) \approx F_θ(x, S(x))$, NSTR reconstructs signals by spatially modulating a compact set of global sinusoidal bases. This formulation enables strong local adaptivity and offers a new level of interpretability via visualizing frequency flows. Experiments on 2D image regression, audio reconstruction, and implicit 3D geometry show that NSTR achieves significantly better accuracy-parameter trade-offs than SIREN, Fourier-feature MLPs, and Instant-NGP. NSTR requires fewer global frequencies, converges faster, and naturally explains signal structure through spectral transport fields. We believe NSTR opens a new direction in INR research by introducing explicit modeling of space-varying spectrum.",human
"This paper demonstrates that progressive localization, the gradual increase of attention locality from early distributed layers to late localized layers, represents the optimal architecture for creating interpretable large language models while preserving performance. Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times. The systematic relationship between localization schedule steepness and performance validates the hypothesis that early layers require distributed processing for feature extraction while late layers benefit from localized, interpretable attention for decision-making. These findings establish progressive localization as the principled approach for building transparent AI systems in safety-critical domains, where human oversight of model reasoning is essential.",human
"This thesis addresses two paradoxes: (1) why empirical studies find that fake news represent only a small share of the information consulted and shared on social media despite the absence of editorial control or journalistic norms, and (2) how political polarization has intensified even though users do not appear especially receptive to fake news. To investigate these issues, two complementary studies were carried out on Twitter and Facebook, combining quantitative analyses of digital traces with online observation and interviews. This mixed-methods design avoids reducing users to single reactions to identified fake items and instead examines the variety of practices across different interactional situations, online and offline, while recording socio-demographic traits. The first study mapped users who shared at least one item labeled fake by fact-checkers in the French Twittersphere. The second used a corpus of items flagged by Facebook users to study reactions to statements whose epistemic status is uncertain. Three main findings emerge. First, sharing fake news is concentrated among a limited group of users who are not less educated or cognitively disadvantaged but are more politicized and critical of institutions; owing to their high activity and prolific sharing, they can help set the agenda for their political camp. Second, exposed users can deploy varying forms of critical distance depending on their social position and the interactional norms of the situations they inhabit: either discursive caution (prudence énonciative) or interventions ('points d'arrêt') that express disagreement or corrections. Third, these forms of critical distance seldom yield genuine deliberative debates or agonistic pluralism; rather, they often produce dialogues of the deaf among a small, particularly active minority.",human
"Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) represents a collaborative architecture in which AAV allocate resources over 6G links to jointly enhance user-intent interpretation and overall network performance. Owing to this mutual dependence, improvements in intent inference and policy decisions on one component reinforce the efficiency of others, making highly reliable intent prediction and low-latency action execution essential. Although numerous approaches can model intent relationships, they encounter severe obstacles when scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and managing intensive on-board computation. We propose an Intent-Driven Framework for Autonomous Network Optimization comprising prediction and decision modules. First, implicit intent modeling is adopted to mitigate inaccuracies arising from ambiguous user expressions. For prediction, we introduce Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT), which embeds data into a Hyperdimensional space via Hyperdimensional vector encoding and replaces standard matrix and attention operations with symbolic Hyperdimensional computations. For decision-making, where AAV must respond to user intent while planning trajectories, we design Double Actions based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO). Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a real IoT action dataset with authentic wireless data. Experimental results demonstrate that HDT and DA-MAPPO achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios.",human
"Building high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) from diverse sources requires combining methods for information extraction, data transformation, ontology mapping, entity matching, and data fusion. Numerous methods and tools exist for each of these tasks, but support for combining them into reproducible and effective end-to-end pipelines is still lacking. We present a new framework, KGpipe for defining and executing integration pipelines that can combine existing tools or LLM (Large Language Model) functionality. To evaluate different pipelines and the resulting KGs, we propose a benchmark to integrate heterogeneous data of different formats (RDF, JSON, text) into a seed KG. We demonstrate the flexibility of KGpipe by running and comparatively evaluating several pipelines integrating sources of the same or different formats using selected performance and quality metrics.",human
"The rise of Generative AI Search is fundamentally transforming how users and intelligent systems interact with the Internet. LLMs increasingly act as intermediaries between humans and web information. Yet the web remains optimized for human browsing rather than AI-driven semantic retrieval, resulting in wasted network bandwidth, lower information quality, and unnecessary complexity for developers. We introduce the concept of an AI-Native Internet, a web architecture in which servers expose semantically relevant information chunks rather than full documents, supported by a Web-native semantic resolver that allows AI applications to discover relevant information sources before retrieving fine-grained chunks. Through motivational experiments, we quantify the inefficiencies of current HTML-based retrieval, and outline architectural directions and open challenges for evolving today's document-centric web into an AI-oriented substrate that better supports semantic access to web content.",human
"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \ Gene \ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.",human
"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Computation (EC) has unlocked new frontiers in scientific discovery but remains shackled by a fundamental constraint: the reliance on an Oracle--an objective, machine-computable fitness function. This paper breaks this barrier by asking: Can evolution thrive in a purely subjective landscape governed solely by LLM judges? We introduce MADE (Multi-Agent Decomposed Evolution), a framework that tames the inherent noise of subjective evaluation through ""Problem Specification."" By decomposing vague instructions into specific, verifiable sub-requirements, MADE transforms high-variance LLM feedback into stable, precise selection pressure. The results are transformative: across complex benchmarks like DevAI and InfoBench, MADE outperforms strong baselines by over 50% in software requirement satisfaction (39.9% to 61.9%) and achieves a 95% perfect pass rate on complex instruction following. This work validates a fundamental paradigm shift: moving from optimizing ""computable metrics"" to ""describable qualities,"" thereby unlocking evolutionary optimization for the vast open-ended domains where no ground truth exists.",human
"The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured outputs that follow arbitrary schemas is crucial to a wide range of downstream tasks that require diverse structured representations of results such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. While modern LLMs excel in generating unstructured responses in natural language, whether this advancement translates to a strong performance on text-to-structure tasks remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting. To facilitate the development of efficient text-to-structure models, we collect high-quality training data via synthetic task generation. Without using any supervised data for OmniStruct tasks, our experiments demonstrate the possibility of fine-tuning much smaller models on synthetic data into universal structured generation models that can rival the performance of GPT-4o.",human
"Urinary tract infection (UTI) flare-ups pose a significant health risk for older adults with chronic conditions. These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches relying on simple binary classification for UTI detection offer limited utility to nurses and practitioners as they lack insight into prediction uncertainty, hindering informed clinical decision-making. This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions (""I don't know"") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width. A survey of 42 nurses confirms that our system's outputs are valuable for guiding clinical decision-making, underscoring their practical utility in improving informed decisions and effectively managing UTIs and other condition flare-ups in older adults.",human
"For online ad-recommendation systems, processing complete user-ad-engagement histories is both computationally intensive and noise-prone. We introduce Dynamix, a scalable, personalized sequence exploration framework that optimizes event history processing using maximum relevance principles and self-supervised learning through Event Based Features (EBFs). Dynamix categorizes users-engagements at session and surface-levels by leveraging correlations between dwell-times and ad-conversion events. This enables targeted, event-level feature removal and selective feature boosting for certain user-segments, thereby yielding training and inference efficiency wins without sacrificing engaging ad-prediction accuracy. While, dynamic resource removal increases training and inference throughput by 1.15% and 1.8%, respectively, dynamic feature boosting provides 0.033 NE gains while boosting inference QPS by 4.2% over baseline models. These results demonstrate that Dynamix achieves significant cost efficiency and performance improvements in online user-sequence based recommendation models. Self-supervised user-segmentation and resource exploration can further boost complex feature selection strategies while optimizing for workflow and compute resources.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

"Brain tumor detection from MRI scans plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.",human
"Psychedelics, such as psilocybin, reorganise large-scale brain connectivity, yet how these changes are reflected across electrophysiological (electroencephalogram, EEG) and haemodynamic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) networks remains unclear. We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.",human
"This paper introduces the approach of ""Gradient Masters"" for BLP-2025 Task 1: ""Bangla Multitask Hate Speech Identification Shared Task"". We present an ensemble-based fine-tuning strategy for addressing subtasks 1A (hate-type classification) and 1B (target group classification) in YouTube comments. We propose a hybrid approach on a Bangla Language Model, which outperformed the baseline models and secured the 6th position in subtask 1A with a micro F1 score of 73.23% and the third position in subtask 1B with 73.28%. We conducted extensive experiments that evaluated the robustness of the model throughout the development and evaluation phases, including comparisons with other Language Model variants, to measure generalization in low-resource Bangla hate speech scenarios and data set coverage. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of our findings, exploring misclassification patterns in the detection of hate speech.",human
"Deep learning training relies on periodic checkpoints to recover from failures, but unsafe checkpoint installation can leave corrupted files on disk. This paper presents an experimental study of checkpoint installation protocols and integrity validation for AI training on macOS/APFS. We implement three write modes with increasing durability guarantees: unsafe (baseline, no fsync), atomic_nodirsync (file-level durability via fsync()), and atomic_dirsync (file + directory durability). We design a format-agnostic integrity guard using SHA-256 checksums with automatic rollback. Through controlled experiments including crash injection (430 unsafe-mode trials) and corruption injection (1,600 atomic-mode trials), we demonstrate that the integrity guard detects 99.8-100% of corruptions with zero false positives. Performance overhead is 56.5-108.4% for atomic_nodirsync and 84.2-570.6% for atomic_dirsync relative to the unsafe baseline. Our findings quantify the reliability-performance trade-offs and provide deployment guidance for production AI infrastructure.",human
"Data-driven learning of soft continuum robot (SCR) dynamics from high-dimensional observations offers flexibility but often lacks physical interpretability, while model-based approaches require prior knowledge and can be computationally expensive. We bridge this gap by introducing (1) the Attention Broadcast Decoder (ABCD), a plug-and-play module for autoencoder-based latent dynamics learning that generates pixel-accurate attention maps localizing each latent dimension's contribution while filtering static backgrounds. (2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications.",human
"Organization's communication is essential for public trust, but the rise of generative AI models has introduced significant challenges by generating persuasive content that can form competing narratives with official messages from government and commercial organizations at speed and scale. This has left agencies in a reactive position, often unaware of how these models construct their persuasive strategies, making it more difficult to sustain communication effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce a large LLM-generated persuasion attack dataset, which includes 134,136 attacks generated by GPT-4, Gemma 2, and Llama 3.1 on agency news. These attacks span 23 persuasive techniques from SemEval 2023 Task 3, directed toward 972 press releases from ten agencies. The generated attacks come in two mediums, press release statements and social media posts, covering both long-form and short-form communication strategies. We analyzed the moral resonance of these persuasion attacks to understand their attack vectors. GPT-4's attacks mainly focus on Care, with Authority and Loyalty also playing a role. Gemma 2 emphasizes Care and Authority, while Llama 3.1 centers on Loyalty and Care. Analyzing LLM-generated persuasive attacks across models will enable proactive defense, allow to create the reputation armor for organizations, and propel the development of both effective and resilient communications in the information ecosystem.",human
"Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.",human
"Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer a promising path toward scalable and efficient large vision-language systems. However, existing approaches rely on rigid routing strategies (typically activating a fixed number of experts per token) ignoring the inherent heterogeneity in semantic importance across modalities. This leads to suboptimal compute allocation, where redundant tokens consume as many resources as critical ones. To address this, we propose AnyExperts, a novel on-demand, budget-aware dynamic routing framework that allocates a variable total number of expert slots per token based on its semantic importance. Crucially, to prevent uncontrolled compute growth, the total slots per token are constrained within a fixed range, and each slot is filled by either a real expert or a virtual expert, with the virtual share capped at a small maximum (e.g., 20%). The model then adaptively balances the real-to-virtual ratio per token, assigning more real experts to semantically rich regions and relying more on virtual experts for redundant content. Evaluated across diverse tasks in visual understanding, audio understanding, and NLP understanding, AnyExperts improves performance under the same compute budget. Notably, on general image/video tasks, it achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer real expert activations; on text-dense tasks (OCR and NLP), it maintains performance while reducing real expert usage by 10%. These results demonstrate that fine-grained, importance-driven expert allocation significantly enhances both the efficiency and effectiveness of multimodal MoE models.",human
"Large Language Model agents often retrieve context from knowledge bases that lack structural consistency with the agent's current reasoning state, leading to incoherent reasoning chains. We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information. These findings suggest that path-constrained retrieval is an effective approach for improving the reliability and coherence of LLM agent reasoning systems.",human
"Time series data plays a pivotal role in a wide variety of fields but faces challenges related to privacy concerns. Recently, synthesizing data via diffusion models is viewed as a promising solution. However, existing methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and complex channel interrelations. In this research, we aim to utilize the sequence modeling capability of a State Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to time series data generation. We firstly analyze the core limitations in State Space Model, namely the lack of consideration for correlated temporal lag and channel permutation. Building upon the insight, we propose Lag Fusion Mamba and Permutation Scanning Mamba, which enhance the model's ability to discern significant patterns during the denoising process. Theoretical analysis reveals that both variants exhibit a unified matrix multiplication framework with the original Mamba, offering a deeper understanding of our method. Finally, we integrate two variants and introduce Diffusion Mamba for Time Series (DiM-TS), a high-quality time series generation model that better preserves the temporal periodicity and inter-channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiM-TS in generating realistic time series while preserving diverse properties of data.",human
"Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.",human
"Building codes contain critical information for ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making in construction and engineering. Automated question answering systems over such codes enable quick and accurate access to specific regulatory clauses, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for this task as they combine the precision of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models. However, tabular data are challenging to extract as they often involve complex layouts, merged cells, multi-row headers, and embedded semantic relationships that are not easily captured by traditional natural language processing techniques and Vision Language Models (VLMs). This paper explores and compares two methods for extracting information from tabular data in building codes using several pre-trained VLMs. First, a direct input method is used, where the image of the page is input directly into the VLMs, which are then tasked with answering questions based on the image. Second, an indirect input method is introduced, which involves converting an image of a page containing tables into the LaTeX code and then answering inquires based on the LaTeX-based input. The experiments find that the direct input method generally resulted in higher accuracy than the indirect input method. To further improve the performance, we fine-tuned each VLM using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific tabular dataset. The fine-tuned models exhibited substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving relative accuracy gains exceeding 100%. Our results highlight the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to adapt powerful VLMs for understanding complex structured data in specialized fields, such as building code interpretation and regulatory compliance.",human
"We present a long-horizon, hierarchical deep research (DR) agent designed for complex materials and device discovery problems that exceed the scope of existing Machine Learning (ML) surrogates and closed-source commercial agents. Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable. Results show that our DR agent produces reports with quality comparable to--and often exceeding--those of commercial systems (ChatGPT-5-thinking/o3/o4-mini-high Deep Research) at a substantially lower cost, while enabling on-prem integration with local data and tools.",human
"Recent work has demonstrated the utility of Random Forest (RF) proximities for various supervised machine learning tasks, including outlier detection, missing data imputation, and visualization. However, the utility of the RF proximities depends upon the success of the RF model, which itself is not the ideal model in all contexts. RF proximities have recently been extended to time series by means of the distance-based Proximity Forest (PF) model, among others, affording time series analysis with the benefits of RF proximities. In this work, we introduce the generalized PF model, thereby extending RF proximities to all contexts in which supervised distance-based machine learning can occur. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the PF model for regression tasks. We also introduce the notion of using the generalized PF model as a meta-learning framework, extending supervised imputation capability to any pre-trained classifier. We experimentally demonstrate the unique advantages of the generalized PF model compared with both the RF model and the $k$-nearest neighbors model.",human
"This investigation presents an empirical analysis of the incompatibility between human psychometric frameworks and Large Language Model evaluation. Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems. The implications extend beyond methodology to challenge assumptions about intelligence, measurement, and anthropomorphic biases in AI evaluation. We propose a framework for developing native machine cognition assessments that recognize the non-human nature of artificial intelligence.",human
"The detection of hallucinations in multilingual scientific text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges for reliable AI systems. This paper describes our submission to the SHROOM-CAP 2025 shared task on scientific hallucination detection across 9 languages. Unlike most approaches that focus primarily on model architecture, we adopted a data-centric strategy that addressed the critical issue of training data scarcity and imbalance. We unify and balance five existing datasets to create a comprehensive training corpus of 124,821 samples (50% correct, 50% hallucinated), representing a 172x increase over the original SHROOM training data. Our approach fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-Large with 560 million parameters on this enhanced dataset, achieves competitive performance across all languages, including \textbf{2nd place in Gujarati} (zero-shot language) with Factuality F1 of 0.5107, and rankings between 4th-6th place across the remaining 8 languages. Our results demonstrate that systematic data curation can significantly outperform architectural innovations alone, particularly for low-resource languages in zero-shot settings.",human
"The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has created significant barriers to cross-disciplinary knowledge discovery, synthesis and research collaboration. In response to this challenge, we present BioSage, a novel compound AI architecture that integrates LLMs with RAG, orchestrated specialized agents and tools to enable discoveries across AI, data science, biomedical, and biosecurity domains. Our system features several specialized agents including the retrieval agent with query planning and response synthesis that enable knowledge retrieval across domains with citation-backed responses, cross-disciplinary translation agents that align specialized terminology and methodologies, and reasoning agents that synthesize domain-specific insights with transparency, traceability and usability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BioSage system through a rigorous evaluation on scientific benchmarks (LitQA2, GPQA, WMDP, HLE-Bio) and introduce a new cross-modal benchmark for biology and AI, showing that our BioSage agents outperform vanilla and RAG approaches by 13\%-21\% powered by Llama 3.1. 70B and GPT-4o models. We perform causal investigations into compound AI system behavior and report significant performance improvements by adding RAG and agents over the vanilla models. Unlike other systems, our solution is driven by user-centric design principles and orchestrates specialized user-agent interaction workflows supporting scientific activities including but not limited to summarization, research debate and brainstorming. Our ongoing work focuses on multimodal retrieval and reasoning over charts, tables, and structured scientific data, along with developing comprehensive multimodal benchmarks for cross-disciplinary discovery. Our compound AI solution demonstrates significant potential for accelerating scientific advancement by reducing barriers between traditionally siloed domains.",human
"Traditional verification methods in chip design are highly time-consuming and computationally demanding, especially for large scale circuits. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity as a potential solution to improve verification efficiency. However, there lacks a joint framework that considers all chip design domain knowledge, graph theory, and GPU kernel designs. To address this challenge, we introduce GROOT, an algorithm and system co-design framework that contains chip design domain knowledge and redesigned GPU kernels, to improve verification efficiency. More specifically, we create node features utilizing the circuit node types and the polarity of the connections between the input edges to nodes in And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs). We utilize a graph partitioning algorithm to divide the large graphs into smaller sub-graphs for fast GPU processing and develop a graph edge re-growth algorithm to recover verification accuracy. We carefully profile the EDA graph workloads and observe the uniqueness of their polarized distribution of high degree (HD) nodes and low degree (LD) nodes. We redesign two GPU kernels (HD-kernel and LD-kernel), to fit the EDA graph learning workload on a single GPU. We compare the results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods: GAMORA, a GNN-based approach, and the traditional ABC framework. Results show that GROOT achieves a significant reduction in memory footprint (59.38 %), with high accuracy (99.96%) for a very large CSA multiplier, i.e. 1,024 bits with a batch size of 16, which consists of 134,103,040 nodes and 268,140,544 edges. We compare GROOT with GPU-based GPU Kernel designs SOTAs such as cuSPARSE, MergePath-SpMM, and GNNAdvisor. We achieve up to 1.104x, 5.796x, and 1.469x improvement in runtime, respectively.",human
"This study presents Part II of an AI-enhanced Decision Support System (DSS), extending Rahimi (2025, Part I) by introducing a fully uncertainty-aware optimization framework for long-term open-pit mine planning. Geological uncertainty is modelled using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on 50,000 spatial grade samples, enabling the generation of probabilistic, multi-scenario orebody realizations that preserve geological continuity and spatial correlation. These scenarios are optimized through a hybrid metaheuristic engine integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA), Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and reinforcement-learning-based adaptive control. An ε-constraint relaxation strategy governs the population exploration phase, allowing near-feasible schedule discovery early in the search and gradual tightening toward strict constraint satisfaction. GPU-parallel evaluation enables the simultaneous assessment of 65,536 geological scenarios, achieving near-real-time feasibility analysis. Results demonstrate up to 1.2 million-fold runtime improvement over IBM CPLEX and significantly higher expected NPV under geological uncertainty, confirming the DSS as a scalable and uncertainty-resilient platform for intelligent mine planning.",human
"Driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), a growing body of work demonstrates the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses in market research and social science applications. Two primary approaches can be applied to improve the performance of LLMs: fine-tuning, which aligns LLM predictions more closely with human responses, and rectification, which corrects biases in LLM outputs. In this paper, we develop a framework that combines fine-tuning and rectification, and optimally allocates limited labeled samples across the two stages. Unlike the conventional objective that minimizes the mean squared prediction errors, we propose to minimize the variance of the prediction errors as the fine-tuning objective, which is optimal for the downstream rectification stage. Building on this insight, we leverage empirical scaling laws to develop a data-driven method for optimally splitting samples between the fine-tuning and rectification stages. Empirical analysis validates our framework, demonstrating improved estimation and inference performance compared to using either fine-tuning or rectification alone.",human
"Neural decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) remains fundamentally limited by poor generalization to unseen subjects, driven by high inter-subject variability and the lack of large-scale datasets to model it effectively. Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.",human
"Accurate multivariate time-series prediction of vital signs and laboratory results is crucial for early intervention and precision medicine in intensive care units (ICUs). However, vital signs are often noisy and exhibit rapid fluctuations, while laboratory tests suffer from missing values, measurement lags, and device-specific bias, making integrative forecasting highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose OmniTFT, a deep learning framework that jointly learns and forecasts high-frequency vital signs and sparsely sampled laboratory results based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Specifically, OmniTFT implements four novel strategies to enhance performance: sliding window equalized sampling to balance physiological states, frequency-aware embedding shrinkage to stabilize rare-class representations, hierarchical variable selection to guide model attention toward informative feature clusters, and influence-aligned attention calibration to enhance robustness during abrupt physiological changes. By reducing the reliance on target-specific architectures and extensive feature engineering, OmniTFT enables unified modeling of multiple heterogeneous clinical targets while preserving cross-institutional generalizability. Across forecasting tasks, OmniTFT achieves substantial performance improvement for both vital signs and laboratory results on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU datasets. Its attention patterns are interpretable and consistent with known pathophysiology, underscoring its potential utility for quantitative decision support in clinical care.",human
"This paper revisits alternating low-rank updates for federated fine-tuning and examines their behavior in decentralized federated learning (DFL). While alternating the LoRA matrices has been shown to stabilize aggregation in centralized FL, extending this mechanism to decentralized, peer-to-peer communication introduces new challenges due to phase-state mismatch and block-wise divergence across clients. We introduce ADF-LoRA, which synchronizes the update of only one low-rank matrix per round and mixes both matrices to maintain more consistent parameter states under decentralized propagation. This design preserves the cross-term suppression effect of alternating updates while improving stability in serverless topologies. We provide a convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions and evaluate ADF-LoRA on multiple GLUE tasks. Experiments show that ADF-LoRA achieves faster and smoother convergence and delivers the highest average accuracy across tasks, outperforming existing LoRA variants in decentralized FL by a consistent margin.",human
"3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes is a fundamental task in 3D perception, but the inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups. We evaluate SwiftVGGT on multiple datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time of recent VGGT-based large-scale reconstruction approaches.",human
"Accurately modeling the relationship between perturbations, transcriptional responses, and phenotypic changes is essential for building an AI Virtual Cell (AIVC). However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.",human
"Foundation models and self-supervised learning (SSL) have become central to modern AI, yet research in this area remains hindered by complex codebases, redundant re-implementations, and the heavy engineering burden of scaling experiments. We present stable-pretraining, a modular, extensible, and performance-optimized library built on top of PyTorch, Lightning, Hugging Face, and TorchMetrics. Unlike prior toolkits focused narrowly on reproducing state-of-the-art results, stable-pretraining is designed for flexibility and iteration speed: it unifies essential SSL utilities--including probes, collapse detection metrics, augmentation pipelines, and extensible evaluation routines--within a coherent and reliable framework. A central design principle is logging everything, enabling fine-grained visibility into training dynamics that makes debugging, monitoring, and reproducibility seamless. We validate the library by demonstrating its ability to generate new research insights with minimal overhead, including depthwise representation probing and the analysis of CLIP degradation under synthetic data finetuning. By lowering barriers to entry while remaining scalable to large experiments, stable-pretraining aims to accelerate discovery and expand the possibilities of foundation model research.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) require precise behavior control for safe and effective deployment across diverse applications.   Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control. We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success. We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering. These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.",human
"Diffusion models (DMs) produce high-quality images, yet their sampling remains costly when adapted to new domains. Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity.",human
"Task-agnostic tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have achieved impressive performance on tabular learning tasks, yet the origins of their inductive biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we study TabPFN through the lens of signal reconstruction and provide the first frequency-based analysis of its in-context learning behavior. We show that TabPFN possesses a broader effective frequency capacity than standard ReLU-MLPs, even without hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, unlike MLPs whose spectra evolve primarily over training epochs, we find that TabPFN's spectral capacity adapts directly to the number of samples provided in-context, a phenomenon we term Spectral Adaptivity. We further demonstrate that positional encoding modulates TabPFN's frequency response, mirroring classical results in implicit neural representations. Finally, we show that these properties enable TabPFN to perform training-free and hyperparameter-free image denoising, illustrating its potential as a task-agnostic implicit model. Our analysis provides new insight into the structure and inductive biases of tabular foundation models and highlights their promise for broader signal reconstruction tasks.",human
"Large Language Models can break through knowledge and timeliness limitations by invoking external tools within the Model Context Protocol framework to achieve automated execution of complex tasks. However, with the rapid growth of enterprise-scale MCP services, efficiently and accurately matching target functionalities among thousands of heterogeneous tools has become a core challenge restricting system practicality. Existing approaches generally rely on full-prompt injection or static semantic retrieval, facing issues including semantic disconnection between user queries and tool descriptions, context inflation in LLM input, and high inference latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Z-Space, a data-generation-oriented multi-agent collaborative tool invocation framework Z-Space. The Z-Space framework establishes a multi-agent collaborative architecture and tool filtering algorithm: (1) A structured semantic understanding of user queries is achieved through an intent parsing model; (2) A tool filtering module (FSWW) based on fused subspace weighted algorithm realizes fine-grained semantic alignment between intents and tools without parameter tuning; (3) An inference execution agent is constructed to support dynamic planning and fault-tolerant execution for multi-step tasks. This framework has been deployed in the Eleme platform's technical division, serving large-scale test data generation scenarios across multiple business units including Taotian, Gaode, and Hema. Production data demonstrates that the system reduces average token consumption in tool inference by 96.26\% while achieving a 92\% tool invocation accuracy rate, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of intelligent test data generation systems.",human
"Digital health interventions are increasingly used in physical and occupational therapy to deliver home exercise programs via sensor equipped devices such as smartphones, enabling remote monitoring of adherence and performance. However, digital interventions are typically programmed as software before clinical encounters as libraries of parametrized exercise modules targeting broad patient populations. At the point of care, clinicians can only select modules and adjust a narrow set of parameters like repetitions, so patient specific needs that emerge during encounters, such as distinct movement limitations, and home environments, are rarely reflected in the software. We evaluated a digital intervention paradigm that uses large language models (LLMs) to translate clinicians' exercise prescriptions into intervention software. In a prospective single arm feasibility study with 20 licensed physical and occupational therapists and a standardized patient, clinicians created 40 individualized upper extremity programs (398 instructions) that were automatically translated into executable software. Our results show a 45% increase in the proportion of personalized prescriptions that can be implemented as software compared with a template based benchmark, with unanimous consensus among therapists on ease of use. The LLM generated software correctly delivered 99.78% (397/398) of instructions as prescribed and monitored performance with 88.4% (352/398) accuracy, with 90% (18/20) of therapists judged it safe to interact with patients, and 75% (15/20) expressed willingness to adopt it. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective evaluation of clinician directed intervention software generation with LLMs in healthcare, demonstrating feasibility and motivating larger trials to assess clinical effectiveness and safety in real patient populations.",human
"Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.",human
"Ensuring that the right resource is available at the right location and time remains a major challenge for organizations operating large-scale logistics networks. The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$κ$ resources for each arc in the network. The framework produces a portfolio of high-quality solutions from which schedulers can select satisfactory trade-offs. The proposed framework is applied to the network of one of the largest package delivery companies in the world, which serves as the primary motivation for this research. Computational results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including an 80% reduction in model size and a 90% decrease in execution time while preserving optimality.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.",human
"Parametric PDEs power modern simulation, design, and digital-twin systems, yet their many-query workloads still hinge on repeatedly solving large finite-element systems. Existing operator-learning approaches accelerate this process but often rely on opaque learned trunks, require extensive labeled data, or break down when boundary and source data vary independently from physical parameters. We introduce RB-DeepONet, a hybrid operator-learning framework that fuses reduced-basis (RB) numerical structure with the branch-trunk architecture of DeepONet. The trunk is fixed to a rigorously constructed RB space generated offline via Greedy selection, granting physical interpretability, stability, and certified error control. The branch network predicts only RB coefficients and is trained label-free using a projected variational residual that targets the RB-Galerkin solution. For problems with independently varying loads or boundary conditions, we develop boundary and source modal encodings that compress exogenous data into low-dimensional coordinates while preserving accuracy. Combined with affine or empirical interpolation decompositions, RB-DeepONet achieves a strict offline-online split: all heavy lifting occurs offline, and online evaluation scales only with the RB dimension rather than the full mesh. We provide convergence guarantees separating RB approximation error from statistical learning error, and numerical experiments show that RB-DeepONet attains accuracy competitive with intrusive RB-Galerkin, POD-DeepONet, and FEONet while using dramatically fewer trainable parameters and achieving significant speedups. This establishes RB-DeepONet as an efficient, stable, and interpretable operator learner for large-scale parametric PDEs.",human
"Pharmaceutical research and development has accumulated vast, heterogeneous archives of data. Much of this knowledge stems from discontinued programs, and reusing these archives is invaluable for reverse translation. However, in practice, such reuse is often infeasible. In this work, we introduce DiscoVerse, a multi-agent co-scientist designed to support pharmaceutical research and development. The system implements semantic retrieval, cross-document linking, and auditable synthesis on a large historical corpus from Roche. To validate our approach at real-world scale, we selected a subset of 180 molecules from the Roche research repositories, covering over 0.87 billion BPE tokens and more than four decades of research. Given that automated evaluation metrics are poorly aligned with scientific utility, we evaluate the performance of DiscoVerse using blinded expert evaluation of source-linked outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first agentic framework systematically assessed on real pharmaceutical data for reverse translation, enabled by authorized access to confidential, end-to-end drug-development archives. Our contributions include role-specialized agent designs aligned with scientist workflows; human-in-the-loop support for reverse translation; expert evaluation; and a large-scale demonstration showing promising answer accuracy and decision-making insights. In brief, across seven benchmark queries covering 180 molecules, DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall ($\geq 0.99$) with moderate precision ($0.71-0.91$), while qualitative assessments of discontinuation rationale and organ-specific toxicity showed faithful, source-linked synthesis across preclinical and clinical evidence.",human
"The convergence of Agentic AI and MAS enables a new paradigm for intelligent decision making in SMS. Traditional MAS architectures emphasize distributed coordination and specialized autonomy, while recent advances in agentic AI driven by LLMs introduce higher order reasoning, planning, and tool orchestration capabilities. This paper presents a hybrid agentic AI and multi agent framework for a Prescriptive Maintenance use case, where LLM based agents provide strategic orchestration and adaptive reasoning, complemented by rule based and SLMs agents performing efficient, domain specific tasks on the edge. The proposed framework adopts a layered architecture that consists of perception, preprocessing, analytics, and optimization layers, coordinated through an LLM Planner Agent that manages workflow decisions and context retention. Specialized agents autonomously handle schema discovery, intelligent feature analysis, model selection, and prescriptive optimization, while a HITL interface ensures transparency and auditability of generated maintenance recommendations. This hybrid design supports dynamic model adaptation, cost efficient maintenance scheduling, and interpretable decision making. An initial proof of concept implementation is validated on two industrial manufacturing datasets. The developed framework is modular and extensible, supporting seamless integration of new agents or domain modules as capabilities evolve. The results demonstrate the system capability to automatically detect schema, adapt preprocessing pipelines, optimize model performance through adaptive intelligence, and generate actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations. The framework shows promise in achieving improved robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, bridging the gap between high level agentic reasoning and low level autonomous execution.",human
"Jointly forecasting trajectories of multiple interacting agents is a core challenge in sports analytics and other domains involving complex group dynamics. Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample. Evaluated on the NBA SportVU, Basketball-U, and Football-U datasets, CausalTraj achieves competitive per-agent accuracy and the best recorded results on joint metrics, while yielding qualitatively coherent and realistic gameplay evolutions.",human
"We derive instance-dependent tail bounds for the regret of optimism-based reinforcement learning in finite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes with unknown transition dynamics. Focusing on a UCBVI-type algorithm, we characterize the tail distribution of the cumulative regret $R_K$ over $K$ episodes, rather than only its expectation or a single high-probability quantile. We analyze two natural exploration-bonus schedules: (i) a $K$-dependent scheme that explicitly incorporates the total number of episodes $K$, and (ii) a $K$-independent scheme that depends only on the current episode index. For both settings, we obtain an upper bound on $\Pr(R_K \ge x)$ that exhibits a distinctive two-regime structure: a sub-Gaussian tail starting from an instance-dependent scale $m_K$ up to a transition threshold, followed by a sub-Weibull tail beyond that point. We further derive corresponding instance-dependent bounds on the expected regret $\mathbb{E}[R_K]$. The proposed algorithm depends on a tuning parameter $α$, which balances the expected regret and the range over which the regret exhibits a sub-Gaussian tail. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide one of the first comprehensive tail-regret guarantees for a standard optimistic algorithm in episodic reinforcement learning.",human
"Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science are transforming chemical research, yet few formal courses are tailored to synthetic and experimental chemists, who often face steep entry barriers due to limited coding experience and lack of chemistry-specific examples. We present the design and implementation of AI4CHEM, an introductory data-driven chem-istry course created for students on the synthetic chemistry track with no prior programming background. The curricu-lum emphasizes chemical context over abstract algorithms, using an accessible web-based platform to ensure zero-install machine learning (ML) workflow development practice and in-class active learning. Assessment combines code-guided homework, literature-based mini-reviews, and collaborative projects in which students build AI-assisted workflows for real experimental problems. Learning gains include increased confidence with Python, molecular property prediction, reaction optimization, and data mining, and improved skills in evaluating AI tools in chemistry. All course materials are openly available, offering a discipline-specific, beginner-accessible framework for integrating AI into synthetic chemistry training.",human
"This study investigates how human experts evaluate the capacity of Generative AI (GenAI) to contextualize STEAM education in the Global South, with a focus on Ghana. Using a convergent mixed-methods design, four STEAM specialists assessed GenAI-generated lesson plans created with a customized Culturally Responsive Lesson Planner (CRLP) and compared them to standardized lesson plans from the Ghana National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA). Quantitative ratings were based on a validated 25-item Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Rubric measuring bias awareness, cultural representation, contextual relevance, linguistic responsiveness, and teacher agency. Qualitative reflections provided additional insight into how GenAI handles cultural and pedagogical appropriateness.   Findings show that GenAI, when paired with the CRLP tool, can support contextualized STEAM instruction by linking abstract curriculum standards to learners' cultural knowledge, community practices, and everyday experiences. Experts rated GenAI-assisted lessons as more culturally grounded and pedagogically responsive than NaCCA plans, integrating Indigenous knowledge, bilingual elements, and locally relevant examples. However, GenAI struggled to represent Ghana's cultural pluralism, often offering surface-level references to language, history, and identity. These weaknesses were most evident in Mathematics and Computing, where cultural nuance was limited. The results highlight the need for continued teacher mediation, community involvement, and culturally attuned refinement of AI outputs. Future work should include classroom trials, expanded expert participation, and model fine-tuning using Indigenous language corpora to strengthen cultural fidelity in Global South contexts.",human
"Public health agencies face critical challenges in identifying high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure with limited resources for outreach and intervention programs. To address this, we develop a Priority Score integrating untested children proportions, elevated blood lead prevalence, and public health coverage patterns to support optimized resource allocation decisions across 136 neighborhoods in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City. Overall accuracy averaged 0.46, reaching a maximum of 0.66 with ChatGPT 5 Deep Research. Despite their marketed deep research capabilities, LLMs struggled with fundamental limitations in information retrieval and evidence-based reasoning, frequently citing outdated data and allowing non-empirical narratives about neighborhood conditions to override quantitative vulnerability indicators.",human
"Quantum machine learning seeks to leverage quantum computers to improve upon classical machine learning algorithms. Currently, robust uncertainty quantification methods remain underdeveloped in the quantum domain, despite the critical need for reliable and trustworthy predictions. Recent work has introduced quantum conformal prediction, a framework that produces prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true outcome with user-specified probability. In this work, we formalise how the time-varying noise inherent in quantum processors can undermine conformal guarantees, even when calibration and test data are exchangeable. To address this challenge, we draw on Adaptive Conformal Inference, a method which maintains validity over time via repeated recalibration. We introduce Adaptive Quantum Conformal Prediction (AQCP), an algorithm which preserves asymptotic average coverage guarantees under arbitrary hardware noise conditions. Empirical studies on an IBM quantum processor demonstrate that AQCP achieves target coverage levels and exhibits greater stability than quantum conformal prediction.",human
"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in defending modern cyber physical systems against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Deep Reinforcement Learning-based IDS, have shown promise due to their adaptive and generalization capabilities. However, recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, including Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which can deceive models with a single, input-agnostic perturbation. In this work, we propose a novel UAP attack against Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based IDS under the domain-specific constraints derived from network data rules and feature relationships. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study that has explored UAP generation for the DRL-based IDS. In addition, this is the first work that focuses on developing a UAP against a DRL-based IDS under realistic domain constraints based on not only the basic domain rules but also mathematical relations between the features. Furthermore, we enhance the evasion performance of the proposed UAP, by introducing a customized loss function based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and we denote it as Customized UAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work using the PCC value in the UAP generation, even in the broader context. Four additional established UAP baselines are implemented for a comprehensive comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Customized UAP outperforms two input-dependent attacks including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and four UAP baselines, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world adversarial scenarios.",human
"This paper proposes SConvTransform, a Transform dialect extension that provides operations for optimizing 2D convolutions in MLIR. Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures. Future work will focus on optimizing performance and porting to other target devices. When applied to standard convolution configurations, the generated code achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512. These results validate the benefit of combining static shape analysis with structured tiling and packing strategies within the MLIR Transform dialect. Furthermore, the modular design of SConvTransform facilitates integration with future extensions, enabling continued optimization of convolution workloads through MLIR's extensible compilation infrastructure.",human
"This research full paper presents an enhancement pipeline for large language models (LLMs) in assessing homework for an undergraduate circuit analysis course, aiming to improve LLMs' capacity to provide personalized support to electrical engineering students. Existing evaluations have demonstrated that GPT-4o possesses promising capabilities in assessing student homework in this domain. Building on these findings, we enhance GPT-4o's performance through multi-step prompting, contextual data augmentation, and the incorporation of targeted hints. These strategies effectively address common errors observed in GPT-4o's responses when using simple prompts, leading to a substantial improvement in assessment accuracy. Specifically, the correct response rate for GPT-4o increases from 74.71% to 97.70% after applying the enhanced prompting and augmented data on entry-level circuit analysis topics. This work lays a foundation for the effective integration of LLMs into circuit analysis instruction and, more broadly, into engineering education.",human
"Uncertainty estimation for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a critical component in control tasks where agents must balance safe exploration and efficient learning. While deep neural networks have enabled breakthroughs in RL, they often lack calibrated uncertainty estimates. We introduce Deep Gaussian Process Proximal Policy Optimization (GPPO), a scalable, model-free actor-critic algorithm that leverages Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) to approximate both the policy and value function. GPPO maintains competitive performance with respect to Proximal Policy Optimization on standard high-dimensional continuous control benchmarks while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that can inform safer and more effective exploration.",human
"We explore surface electromyography (sEMG) as a non-invasive input modality for mapping muscle activity to keyboard inputs, targeting immersive typing in next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI). This is especially relevant for spatial computing and virtual reality (VR), where traditional keyboards are impractical. Using attention-based architectures, we significantly outperform the existing convolutional baselines, reducing online generic CER from 24.98% -> 20.34% and offline personalized CER from 10.86% -> 10.10%, while remaining fully causal. We further incorporate a lightweight decoding pipeline with language-model-based correction, demonstrating the feasibility of accurate, real-time muscle-driven text input for future wearable and spatial interfaces.",human
"The Hausdorff distance (HD) is a robust measure of set dissimilarity, but computing it exactly on large, high-dimensional datasets is prohibitively expensive. We propose \textbf{ProHD}, a projection-guided approximation algorithm that dramatically accelerates HD computation while maintaining high accuracy. ProHD identifies a small subset of candidate ""extreme"" points by projecting the data onto a few informative directions (such as the centroid axis and top principal components) and computing the HD on this subset. This approach guarantees an underestimate of the true HD with a bounded additive error and typically achieves results within a few percent of the exact value. In extensive experiments on image, physics, and synthetic datasets (up to two million points in $D=256$), ProHD runs 10--100$\times$ faster than exact algorithms while attaining 5--20$\times$ lower error than random sampling-based approximations. Our method enables practical HD calculations in scenarios like large vector databases and streaming data, where quick and reliable set distance estimation is needed.",human
"Ecological Momentary Assessment provides real-time data on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, but predicting suicide attempts remains challenging due to their rarity and patient heterogeneity. We show that single models fit to all patients perform poorly, while individualized models improve performance but still overfit to patients with limited data. To address this, we introduce Latent Similarity Gaussian Processes (LSGPs) to capture patient heterogeneity, enabling those with little data to leverage similar patients' trends. Preliminary results show promise: even without kernel-design, we outperform all but one baseline while offering a new understanding of patient similarity.",human
"With the rapid evolution of large language models, retrieval enhanced generation technology has been widely used due to its ability to integrate external knowledge to improve output accuracy. However, the performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieval module. If the retrieval results have low relevance to user needs or contain noisy information, it will directly lead to distortion of the generated content. In response to the performance bottleneck of existing models in processing tabular features, this paper proposes an XGBoost machine learning regression model based on feature engineering and particle swarm optimization. Correlation analysis shows that answer_quality is positively correlated with doc_delevance by 0.66, indicating that document relevance has a significant positive effect on answer quality, and improving document relevance may enhance answer quality; The strong negative correlations between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity were -0.89 and -0.88, respectively, indicating a tradeoff between semantic similarity, redundancy, and diversity. In other words, as the former two increased, diversity significantly decreased. The experimental results comparing decision trees, AdaBoost, etc. show that the VMD PSO BiLSTM model is superior in all evaluation indicators, with significantly lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE compared to the comparison model. The R2 value is higher, indicating that its prediction accuracy, stability, and data interpretation ability are more outstanding. This achievement provides an effective path for optimizing the retrieval quality and improving the generation effect of RAG system, and has important value in promoting the implementation and application of related technologies.",human
"Recent advances in Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration and retrieval of specialized, parallelized subagents, each equipped with hundreds or thousands of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools. However, existing agent, MCP, and retrieval methods typically match queries against a single agent description, obscuring fine-grained tool capabilities of each agent, resulting in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Agent-as-a-Graph retrieval, a knowledge graph retrieval augmented generation approach that represents both tools and their parent agents as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph. During retrieval, i) relevant agents and tool nodes are first retrieved through vector search, ii) we apply a type-specific weighted reciprocal rank fusion (wRRF) for reranking tools and agents, and iii) parent agents are traversed in the knowledge graph for the final set of agents. We evaluate Agent-as-a-Graph on the LiveMCPBenchmark, achieving 14.9% and 14.6% improvements in Recall@5 and nDCG@5 over prior state-of-the-art retrievers, and 2.4% improvements in wRRF optimizations.",human
"Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.",human
"Modern web applications--from real-time content recommendation and dynamic pricing to CDN optimization--increasingly rely on time-series forecasting to deliver personalized experiences to billions of users. Large-scale Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time-series forecasting but suffer from high computational costs, limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive web applications. To address this challenge, we propose a general inference acceleration framework that adapts speculative decoding to autoregressive time-series models. Our approach employs a smaller ""draft"" model to propose future time-series patches, which are then verified in parallel by a larger ""target"" model, reducing the number of sequential forward passes required. We address key technical challenges in adapting this technique from discrete language tokens to continuous time-series distributions, including the design of acceptance criteria for multivariate Gaussian patches and practical variants that balance efficiency with accuracy. Through experiments on time series forecasting benchmarks relevant to web applications, we demonstrate significant inference speedups while maintaining competitive accuracy. The framework requires no architectural modifications to existing foundation models, making it immediately applicable to accelerate deployed time-series forecasting systems. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/PranavSubbaraman/STRIDE",human
"This paper introduces the Creative Intelligence Loop (CIL), a novel socio-technical framework for responsible human-AI co-creation. Rooted in the 'Workflow as Medium' paradigm, the CIL proposes a disciplined structure for dynamic human-AI collaboration, guiding the strategic integration of diverse AI teammates who function as collaborators while the human remains the final arbiter for ethical alignment and creative integrity. The CIL was empirically demonstrated through the practice-led creation of two graphic novellas, investigating how AI could serve as an effective creative colleague within a subjective medium lacking objective metrics. The process required navigating multifaceted challenges including AI's 'jagged frontier' of capabilities, sycophancy, and attention-scarce feedback environments. This prompted iterative refinement of teaming practices, yielding emergent strategies: a multi-faceted critique system integrating adversarial AI roles to counter sycophancy, and prioritizing 'feedback-ready' concrete artifacts to elicit essential human critique. The resulting graphic novellas analyze distinct socio-technical governance failures: 'The Steward' examines benevolent AI paternalism in smart cities, illustrating how algorithmic hubris can erode freedom; 'Fork the Vote' probes democratic legitimacy by comparing centralized AI opacity with emergent collusion in federated networks. This work contributes a self-improving framework for responsible human-AI co-creation and two graphic novellas designed to foster AI literacy and dialogue through accessible narrative analysis of AI's societal implications.",human
"This paper addresses a critical gap in Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL) by introducing the first dedicated inner-loop actor-critic framework for continuous state and action spaces: Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MOMA-AC). Building on single-objective, single-agent algorithms, we instantiate this framework with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), yielding MOMA-TD3 and MOMA-DDPG. The framework combines a multi-headed actor network, a centralised critic, and an objective preference-conditioning architecture, enabling a single neural network to encode the Pareto front of optimal trade-off policies for all agents across conflicting objectives in a continuous MOMARL setting. We also outline a natural test suite for continuous MOMARL by combining a pre-existing multi-agent single-objective physics simulator with its multi-objective single-agent counterpart. Evaluating cooperative locomotion tasks in this suite, we show that our framework achieves statistically significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume relative to outer-loop and independent training baselines, while demonstrating stable scalability as the number of agents increases. These results establish our framework as a foundational step towards robust, scalable multi-objective policy learning in continuous multi-agent domains.",human
"Accurate prediction of engine-out NOx is essential for meeting stringent emissions regulations and optimizing engine performance. Traditional approaches rely on models trained on data from a small number of engines, which can be insufficient in generalizing across an entire population of engines due to sensor biases and variations in input conditions. In real world applications, these models require tuning or calibration to maintain acceptable error tolerance when applied to other engines. This highlights the need for models that can adapt with minimal adjustments to accommodate engine-to-engine variability and sensor discrepancies. While previous studies have explored machine learning methods for predicting engine-out NOx, these approaches often fail to generalize reliably across different engines and operating environments. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian calibration framework that combines Gaussian processes with approximate Bayesian computation to infer and correct sensor biases. Starting with a pre-trained model developed using nominal engine data, our method identifies engine specific sensor biases and recalibrates predictions accordingly. By incorporating these inferred biases, our approach generates posterior predictive distributions for engine-out NOx on unseen test data, achieving high accuracy without retraining the model. Our results demonstrate that this transferable modeling approach significantly improves the accuracy of predictions compared to conventional non-adaptive GP models, effectively addressing engine-to-engine variability and improving model generalizability.",human
"Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are increasingly adopted in large language models (LLMs) for their scalability and efficiency. However, their modular structure introduces a unique vulnerability: adversaries can attempt to compress or repurpose models by pruning experts and cheaply fine-tuning the remainder, effectively bypassing licensing and security constraints. In this paper, we systematically study the prunability of MoE-LLMs under task-specific usage. We first develop an expert attribution framework that identifies the subset of experts most responsible for a given task, then evaluate the performance trade-offs of pruning and re-aligning these experts using active learning-driven fine-tuning. Our findings reveal a critical knowledge loss--recovery trade-off: while certain experts can be isolated to retain task accuracy, significant degradation occurs without targeted re-alignment. Based on this analysis, we propose defense strategies that aim to make MoE models harder to compress and fine-tune without authorization, including entangled expert training and selective fine-tuning protocols that resist unauthorized adaptation. By positioning expert pruning as both a threat vector and a defense target, this work highlights the dual-use nature of MoE modularity and provides the first systematic evaluation framework for secure specialization of MoE-LLMs.",human
"Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models to answer financial questions using external knowledge bases of U.S. SEC filings, earnings reports, and regulatory documents. However, existing work lacks systematic comparison of vector-based and non-vector RAG architectures for financial documents, and the empirical impact of advanced RAG techniques on retrieval accuracy, answer quality, latency, and cost remain unclear. We present the first systematic evaluation comparing vector-based agentic RAG using hybrid search and metadata filtering against hierarchical node-based systems that traverse document structure without embeddings. We evaluate two enhancement techniques applied to the vector-based architecture, i) cross-encoder reranking for retrieval precision, and ii) small-to-big chunk retrieval for context completeness. Across 1,200 SEC 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings on a 150-question benchmark, we measure retrieval metrics (MRR, Recall@5), answer quality through LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons, latency, and preprocessing costs. Vector-based agentic RAG achieves a 68% win rate over hierarchical node-based systems with comparable latency (5.2 compared to 5.98 seconds). Cross-encoder reranking achieves a 59% absolute improvement at optimal parameters (10, 5) for MRR@5. Small-to-big retrieval achieves a 65% win rate over baseline chunking with only 0.2 seconds additional latency. Our findings reveal that applying advanced RAG techniques to financial Q&A systems improves retrieval accuracy, answer quality, and has cost-performance tradeoffs to be considered in production.",human
"Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is a crucial component of particle physics experiments and ensures that the recorded data is of the highest quality, and suitable for subsequent physics analysis. Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the process of collecting high-quality data is unavoidable. Since DQM relies on real experimental data, it is inherently tied to the specific detector substructure and technology in operation. In this work, a simulation-driven approach to DQM is proposed, enabling the study and development of data-quality methodologies in a controlled environment. Using a modified version of Delphes -- a fast, multi-purpose detector simulation -- the preliminary realization of a framework is demonstrated which leverages ML to identify detector anomalies as well as localize the malfunctioning components responsible. We introduce MEDIC (Monitoring for Event Data Integrity and Consistency), a neural network designed to learn detector behavior and perform DQM tasks to look for potential faults. Although the present implementation adopts a simplified setup for computational ease, where large detector regions are deliberately deactivated to mimic faults, this work represents an initial step toward a comprehensive ML-based DQM framework. The encouraging results underline the potential of simulation-driven studies as a foundation for developing more advanced, data-driven DQM systems for future particle detectors.",human
"Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard for modelling business processes. While automated planning has been proposed as a method for simulating and reasoning about BPMN workflows, most implementations remain incomplete or limited in scope. This project builds upon prior theoretical work to develop a functional pipeline that translates BPMN 2.0 diagrams into PDDL representations suitable for planning. The system supports core BPMN constructs, including tasks, events, sequence flows, and gateways, with initial support for parallel and inclusive gateway behaviour. Using a non-deterministic planner, we demonstrate how to generate and evaluate valid execution traces. Our implementation aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical tooling, providing a foundation for further exploration of translating business processes into well-defined plans.",human
"We propose and analyze a variant of Sparse Polyak for high dimensional M-estimation problems. Sparse Polyak proposes a novel adaptive step-size rule tailored to suitably estimate the problem's curvature in the high-dimensional setting, guaranteeing that the algorithm's performance does not deteriorate when the ambient dimension increases. However, convergence guarantees can only be obtained by sacrificing solution sparsity and statistical accuracy. In this work, we introduce a variant of Sparse Polyak that retains its desirable scaling properties with respect to the ambient dimension while obtaining sparser and more accurate solutions.",human
"The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Automated Planning (AP) models has been widely explored; however, their application to Hierarchical Planning (HP) is still far from reaching the level of sophistication observed in non-hierarchical architectures. In this work, we try to address this gap. We present two main contributions. First, we propose L2HP, an extension of L2P (a library to LLM-driven PDDL models generation) that support HP model generation and follows a design philosophy of generality and extensibility. Second, we apply our framework to perform experiments where we compare the modeling capabilities of LLMs for AP and HP. On the PlanBench dataset, results show that parsing success is limited but comparable in both settings (around 36\%), while syntactic validity is substantially lower in the hierarchical case (1\% vs. 20\% of instances). These findings underscore the unique challenges HP presents for LLMs, highlighting the need for further research to improve the quality of generated HP models.",human
"Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.",human
"In order to predict the next token, LLMs must represent semantic and surface-level information about the current word. Previous work identified two types of attention heads that disentangle this information: (i) Concept induction heads, which copy word meanings, and (ii) Token induction heads, which copy literal token representations (Feucht et al., 2025). We show that these heads can be used to identify subspaces of model activations that exhibit coherent semantic structure in Llama-2-7b. Specifically, when we transform hidden states using the attention weights of concept heads, we are able to more accurately perform parallelogram arithmetic (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the resulting hidden states, e.g., showing that ""Athens"" - ""Greece"" + ""China"" = ""Beijing"". This transformation allows for much higher nearest-neighbor accuracy (80%) than direct use of raw hidden states (47%). Analogously, we show that token heads allow for transformations that reveal surface-level word information in hidden states, allowing for operations like ""coding"" - ""code"" + ""dance"" = ""dancing"".",human
"Masked diffusion models (MDMs) are a promising alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs), but they suffer from inherently much higher training variance. High variance leads to noisier gradient estimates and unstable optimization, so even equally strong pretrained MDMs and ARMs that are competitive at initialization often diverge after task-specific training, with MDMs falling far behind. There has been no theoretical explanation or systematic solution. We derive the first decomposition of MDM training variance into three sources: (A) masking pattern noise, (B) masking rate noise, and (C) data noise, while ARMs are only affected by (C). This explains the fundamental training gap. Building on this foundation, we design six variance-reduction methods, including two core methods: (1) P-POTS, a Pareto-optimal t sampler that minimizes training variance by sampling harder t values more often with appropriately smaller update steps, and (2) MIRROR, which uses negatively correlated samples to reduce (A). Experiments show that compared to standard MDM training, our methods improve accuracy by 7-8% on complex reasoning tasks, while simultaneously reducing run-to-run variability to near ARM levels, substantially narrowing the gap with strong ARM baselines; in most settings, even the best baseline runs remain below the worst run of our method.",human
"We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.",human
"Indoor localization systems commonly rely on fingerprinting, which requires extensive survey efforts to obtain location-tagged signal data, limiting their real-world deployability. Recent approaches that attempt to reduce this overhead either suffer from low representation ability, mode collapse issues, or require the effort of collecting data at all target locations. We present LocaGen, a novel spatial augmentation framework that significantly reduces fingerprinting overhead by generating high-quality synthetic data at completely unseen locations. LocaGen leverages a conditional diffusion model guided by a novel spatially aware optimization strategy to synthesize realistic fingerprints at unseen locations using only a subset of seen locations. To further improve our diffusion model performance, LocaGen augments seen location data based on domain-specific heuristics and strategically selects the seen and unseen locations using a novel density-based approach that ensures robust coverage. Our extensive evaluation on a real-world WiFi fingerprinting dataset shows that LocaGen maintains the same localization accuracy even with 30% of the locations unseen and achieves up to 28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art augmentation methods.",human
"Three-dimensional rigid-body transforms, i.e. rotations and translations, are central to modern differentiable machine learning pipelines in robotics, vision, and simulation. However, numerically robust and mathematically correct implementations, particularly on SO(3), are error-prone due to issues such as axis conventions, normalizations, composition consistency and subtle errors that only appear in edge cases. SciPy's spatial$.$transform module is a rigorously tested Python implementation. However, it historically only supported NumPy, limiting adoption in GPU-accelerated and autodiff-based workflows. We present a complete overhaul of SciPy's spatial$.$transform functionality that makes it compatible with any array library implementing the Python array API, including JAX, PyTorch, and CuPy. The revised implementation preserves the established SciPy interface while enabling GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and differentiation via native autodiff of the chosen backend. We demonstrate how this foundation supports differentiable scientific computing through two case studies: (i) scalability of 3D transforms and rotations and (ii) a JAX drone simulation that leverages SciPy's Rotation for accurate integration of rotational dynamics. Our contributions have been merged into SciPy main and will ship in the next release, providing a framework-agnostic, production-grade basis for 3D spatial math in differentiable systems and ML.",human
"Delicate snap-fit assemblies, such as inserting a lens into an eye-wear frame or during electronics assembly, demand timely engagement detection and rapid force attenuation to prevent overshoot-induced component damage or assembly failure. We address these challenges with two key contributions. First, we introduce SnapNet, a lightweight neural network that detects snap-fit engagement from joint-velocity transients in real-time, showing that reliable detection can be achieved using proprioceptive signals without external sensors. Second, we present a dynamical-systems-based dual-arm coordination framework that integrates SnapNet driven detection with an event-triggered impedance modulation, enabling accurate alignment and compliant insertion during delicate snap-fit assemblies. Experiments across diverse geometries on a heterogeneous bimanual platform demonstrate high detection accuracy (over 96% recall) and up to a 30% reduction in peak impact forces compared to standard impedance control.",human
"Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.",human
"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution ""context stream"" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity ""insight stream"" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.",human
"As the demand grows for scalable and privacy-aware AI systems, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution, allowing decentralized model training without moving raw data. At the same time, the combination of high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud infrastructure offers vast computing power but introduces new complexities, especially when dealing with heterogeneous hardware, communication limits, and non-uniform data. In this work, we present a federated learning framework built to run efficiently across mixed HPC and cloud environments. Our system addresses key challenges such as system heterogeneity, communication overhead, and resource scheduling, while maintaining model accuracy and data privacy. Through experiments on a hybrid testbed, we demonstrate strong performance in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, and convergence, even under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data distributions and varied hardware. These results highlight the potential of federated learning as a practical approach to building scalable Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in modern, distributed computing settings.",human
"We investigate machine learning approaches to approximating the \emph{domination number} of graphs, the minimum size of a dominating set. Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.",human
"This study introduce GeeSanBhava, a high-quality data set of Sinhala song comments extracted from YouTube manually tagged using Russells Valence-Arousal model by three independent human annotators. The human annotators achieve a substantial inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss kappa = 84.96%). The analysis revealed distinct emotional profiles for different songs, highlighting the importance of comment based emotion mapping. The study also addressed the challenges of comparing comment-based and song-based emotions, mitigating biases inherent in user-generated content. A number of Machine learning and deep learning models were pre-trained on a related large data set of Sinhala News comments in order to report the zero-shot result of our Sinhala YouTube comment data set. An optimized Multi-Layer Perceptron model, after extensive hyperparameter tuning, achieved a ROC-AUC score of 0.887. The model is a three-layer MLP with a configuration of 256, 128, and 64 neurons. This research contributes a valuable annotated dataset and provides insights for future work in Sinhala Natural Language Processing and music emotion recognition.",human
"In this work, we propose a set of conformal prediction procedures tailored to compositional responses, where outcomes are proportions that must be positive and sum to one. Building on Dirichlet regression, we introduce a split conformal approach based on quantile residuals and a highest-density region strategy that combines a fast coordinate-floor approximation with an internal grid refinement to restore sharpness. Both constructions are model-agnostic at the conformal layer and guarantee finite-sample marginal coverage under exchangeability, while respecting the geometry of the simplex. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study spanning homoscedastic and heteroscedastic designs shows that the quantile residual and grid-refined HDR methods achieve empirical coverage close to the nominal 90\% level and produce substantially narrower regions than the coordinate-floor approximation, which tends to be conservative. We further demonstrate the methods on household budget shares from the BudgetItaly dataset, using standardized socioeconomic and price covariates with a train, calibration, and test split. In this application, the grid-refined HDR attains coverage closest to the target with the smallest average widths, closely followed by the quantile residual approach, while the simple triangular HDR yields wider, less informative sets. Overall, the results indicate that conformal prediction on the simplex can be both calibrated and efficient, providing practical uncertainty quantification for compositional prediction tasks.",human
"We propose Observer Actor (ObAct), a novel framework for active vision imitation learning in which the observer moves to optimal visual observations for the actor. We study ObAct on a dual-arm robotic system equipped with wrist-mounted cameras. At test time, ObAct dynamically assigns observer and actor roles: the observer arm constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation from three images, virtually explores this to find an optimal camera pose, then moves to this pose; the actor arm then executes a policy using the observer's observations. This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies. We study this formulation with two existing imitation learning methods -- trajectory transfer and behavior cloning -- and experiments show that ObAct significantly outperforms static-camera setups: trajectory transfer improves by 145% without occlusion and 233% with occlusion, while behavior cloning improves by 75% and 143%, respectively. Videos are available at https://obact.github.io.",human
"Multimodal learning has shown significant superiority on various tasks by integrating multiple modalities. However, the interdependencies among modalities increase the susceptibility of multimodal models to adversarial attacks. Existing methods mainly focus on attacks on specific modalities or indiscriminately attack all modalities. In this paper, we find that these approaches ignore the differences between modalities in their contribution to final robustness, resulting in suboptimal robustness performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vulnerability-Aware Robust Multimodal Adversarial Training (VARMAT), a probe-in-training adversarial training method that improves multimodal robustness by identifying the vulnerability of each modality. To be specific, VARMAT first explicitly quantifies the vulnerability of each modality, grounded in a first-order approximation of the attack objective (Probe). Then, we propose a targeted regularization term that penalizes modalities with high vulnerability, guiding robust learning while maintaining task accuracy (Training). We demonstrate the enhanced robustness of our method across multiple multimodal datasets involving diverse modalities. Finally, we achieve {12.73%, 22.21%, 11.19%} robustness improvement on three multimodal datasets, revealing a significant blind spot in multimodal adversarial training.",human
"Existing methods for label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS) either rely on consistency constraints or Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions. Code will be released.",human
"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.",human
"While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

"Pediatric liver tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatrics, with differentiation of benign or malignant status and pathological classification critical for clinical treatment. While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses. This framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides actionable insights for CT phase selection and model design, and paves the way for precise, accessible pediatric liver tumor diagnosis.",human
"Accurately solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is critical to understanding complex scientific and engineering phenomena, yet traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive. Surrogate models offer a more efficient alternative, but their development is hindered by the cost of generating sufficient training data from numerical solvers. In this paper, we present a novel framework for active learning (AL) in PDE surrogate modeling that reduces this cost. Unlike the existing AL methods for PDEs that always acquire entire PDE trajectories, our approach strategically generates only the most important time steps with the numerical solver, while employing the surrogate model to approximate the remaining steps. This dramatically reduces the cost incurred by each trajectory and thus allows the active learning algorithm to try out a more diverse set of trajectories given the same budget. To accommodate this novel framework, we develop an acquisition function that estimates the utility of a set of time steps by approximating its resulting variance reduction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers' equation, Korteweg-De Vries equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equation. Experiments show that our approach improves performance by large margins over the best existing method. Our method not only reduces average error but also the 99\%, 95\%, and 50\% quantiles of error, which is rare for an AL algorithm. All in all, our approach offers a data-efficient solution to surrogate modeling for PDEs.",human
"Modern transformer architectures achieve remarkable performance across tasks and domains but remain rigid in how they allocate computation at inference time. Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Finally, we show how AdaPerceiver equipped with a policy can maintain ImageNet1K accuracy ($\pm0.1$ percentage points) while reducing FLOPs by $24-33$%.",human
"Labeled Markov Chains (or LMCs for short) are useful mathematical objects to model complex probabilistic languages. A central challenge is to compare two LMCs, for example to assess the accuracy of an abstraction or to quantify the effect of model perturbations. In this work, we study the recently introduced Cantor-Kantorovich (or CK) distance. In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation. More precisely, we show that the exact computation of the CK distance is #P-hard. We also provide an upper bound on the CK distance as a function of the approximation relation between the two LMCs, and show that a bounded CK distance implies a bounded error between probabilities of finite-horizon traces. Finally, we provide a computable approximation scheme, and show that the latter is also #P-hard. Altogether, our results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the CK distance and clarify its relationship with existing distances.",human
"This paper presents an empirical investigation into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform automated Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) policy mining. While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifically Google Gemini (Flash and Pro) and OpenAI ChatGPT, as potential policy mining engines. An experimental framework was developed in Python to generate randomized access data parameterized by varying numbers of subjects, objects, and initial policy sets. The baseline policy sets, which govern permission decisions between subjects and objects, serve as the ground truth for comparison. Each LLM-generated policy was evaluated against the baseline policy using standard performance metrics. The results indicate that LLMs can effectively infer compact and valid ABAC policies for small-scale scenarios. However, as the system size increases, characterized by higher numbers of subjects and objects, LLM outputs exhibit declining accuracy and precision, coupled with significant increase in the size of policy generated, which is beyond the optimal size. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLM architectures for scalable policy mining in access control domains. Future work will explore hybrid approaches that combine prompt optimization with classical rule mining algorithms to improve scalability and interpretability in complex ABAC environments.",human
"Predictive control approaches based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained significant attention in microgrid energy optimization. However, existing research often overlooks the issue of uncertainty stemming from imperfect prediction models, which can lead to suboptimal control strategies. This paper presents a new error temporal difference (ETD) algorithm for DRL to address the uncertainty in predictions,aiming to improve the performance of microgrid operations. First,a microgrid system integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS), along with its Markov decision process (MDP), is modelled. Second, a predictive control approach based on a deep Q network (DQN) is presented, in which a weighted average algorithm and a new ETD algorithm are designed to quantify and address the prediction uncertainty, respectively. Finally, simulations on a realworld US dataset suggest that the developed ETD effectively improves the performance of DRL in optimizing microgrid operations.",human
"Developing general robot intelligence in open environments requires continual skill learning. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support, yet aligning them with the multifaceted reasoning pathways of real-world medicine remains a major challenge. Using more than 8,000 infertility treatment records, we systematically evaluate four alignment strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) through a dual-layer framework combining automatic benchmarks with blinded doctor-in-the-loop assessments. GRPO achieves the highest algorithmic accuracy across multiple decision layers, confirming the value of reinforcement-based optimization for structured prediction tasks. However, clinicians consistently prefer the SFT model, citing clearer reasoning processes (p = 0.035) and higher therapeutic feasibility (p = 0.019). In blinded pairwise comparisons, SFT attains the highest winning rate (51.2%), outperforming both GRPO (26.2%) and even physicians' original decisions (22.7%). These results reveal an alignment paradox: algorithmic improvements do not necessarily translate into higher clinical trust, and may diverge from human-centered preferences. Our findings highlight the need for alignment strategies that prioritize clinically interpretable and practically feasible reasoning, rather than solely optimizing decision-level accuracy.",human
"Accurate modeling of time-varying underwater acoustic channels is essential for the design, evaluation, and deployment of reliable underwater communication systems. Conventional physics models require detailed environmental knowledge, while stochastic replay methods are constrained by the limited diversity of measured channels and often fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, reducing their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose StableUASim, a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion surrogate model that captures the stochastic dynamics of underwater acoustic communication channels. Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that StableUASim accurately reproduces key channel characteristics and communication performance, providing a scalable, data-efficient, and physically consistent surrogate model for both system design and machine learning-driven underwater applications.",human
"This research proposes an enhancement to the innovative portfolio optimization approach using the G-Learning algorithm, combined with parametric optimization via the GIRL algorithm (G-learning approach to the setting of Inverse Reinforcement Learning) as presented by. The goal is to maximize portfolio value by a target date while minimizing the investor's periodic contributions. Our model operates in a highly volatile market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., lambda = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfolio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already enable robust optimization. This research contributes to the growing development of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision-making, demonstrating that probabilistic learning algorithms can effectively align portfolio management strategies with investor needs.",human
"Test-time adaptation (TTA) in federated learning (FL) is crucial for handling unseen data distributions across clients, particularly when faced with domain shifts and skewed class distributions. Class Imbalance (CI) remains a fundamental challenge in FL, where rare but critical classes are often severely underrepresented in individual client datasets. Although prior work has addressed CI during training through reliable aggregation and local class distribution alignment, these methods typically rely on access to labeled data or coordination among clients, and none address class unsupervised adaptation to dynamic domains or distribution shifts at inference time under federated CI constraints. Revealing the failure of state-of-the-art TTA in federated client adaptation in CI scenario, we propose pFedBBN,a personalized federated test-time adaptation framework that employs balanced batch normalization (BBN) during local client adaptation to mitigate prediction bias by treating all classes equally, while also enabling client collaboration guided by BBN similarity, ensuring that clients with similar balanced representations reinforce each other and that adaptation remains aligned with domain-specific characteristics. pFedBBN supports fully unsupervised local adaptation and introduces a class-aware model aggregation strategy that enables personalized inference without compromising privacy. It addresses both distribution shifts and class imbalance through balanced feature normalization and domain-aware collaboration, without requiring any labeled or raw data from clients. Extensive experiments across diverse baselines show that pFedBBN consistently enhances robustness and minority-class performance over state-of-the-art FL and TTA methods.",human
"Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) gradient flows have been recently proposed as a powerful sampling tool that combines the advantages of pure Wasserstein (W) and pure Fisher-Rao (FR) gradient flows. Existing algorithmic developments implicitly make use of operator splitting techniques to numerically approximate the WFR partial differential equation, whereby the W flow is evaluated over a given step size and then the FR flow (or vice versa). This works investigates the impact of the order in which the W and FR operator are evaluated and aims to provide a quantitative analysis. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that with a judicious choice of step size and operator ordering, the split scheme can converge to the target distribution faster than the exact WFR flow (in terms of model time). We obtain variational formulae describing the evolution over one time step of both sequential splitting schemes and investigate in which settings the W-FR split should be preferred to the FR-W split. As a step towards this goal we show that the WFR gradient flow preserves log-concavity and obtain the first sharp decay bound for WFR.",human
"Hierarchical clustering seeks to uncover nested structures in data by constructing a tree of clusters, where deeper levels reveal finer-grained relationships. Traditional methods, including linkage approaches, face three major limitations: (i) they always return a hierarchy, even if none exists, (ii) they are restricted to binary trees, even if the true hierarchy is non-binary, and (iii) they are highly sensitive to the choice of linkage function. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing the notion of a valid hierarchy and defining a partial order over the set of valid hierarchies. We prove the existence of a finest valid hierarchy, that is, the hierarchy that encodes the maximum information consistent with the similarity structure of the data set. In particular, the finest valid hierarchy is not constrained to binary structures and, when no hierarchical relationships exist, collapses to a star tree. We propose a simple two-step algorithm that first constructs a binary tree via a linkage method and then prunes it to enforce validity. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the linkage function under which this procedure exactly recovers the finest valid hierarchy, and we show that all linkage functions satisfying these conditions yield the same hierarchy after pruning. Notably, classical linkage rules such as single, complete, and average satisfy these conditions, whereas Ward's linkage fails to do so.",human
"Recent advances in text-driven image editing have been significant, yet the task of accurately evaluating these edited images continues to pose a considerable challenge. Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate IE-Critic-R1's superior subjective-alignments on the text-driven image editing task compared with previous metrics. Related data and codes are available to the public.",human
"High-quality training data is fundamental to large language model (LLM) performance, yet existing preprocessing pipelines often struggle to effectively remove noise and unstructured content from web-scale corpora. This paper presents Blu-WERP, a novel data preprocessing pipeline designed to optimize the quality of Common Crawl WARC files for LLM training. We demonstrate that Blu-WERP significantly outperforms established baselines including DCLM across multiple model scales and evaluation benchmarks. Our pipeline processes CC WARC dumps, implementing advanced filtering and quality assessment mechanisms. We conducted comprehensive evaluations using models with 150M, 400M, 530M, 750M, and 1B parameters, testing against nine standard benchmarks categorized as World Knowledge & Reasoning, Language Understanding, and Commonsense Reasoning. Results show Blu-WERP consistently achieved superior performance across all model scales. At the 1B parameter scale, Relatively Blu-WERP demonstrates a 4.0% and 9.5% aggregate improvement over DCLM and Fineweb respectively, while achieving quality-per-token efficiency gain. Categorical analysis reveals 2.4% improvement in World Knowledge & Reasoning, 6.2% improvement in Language Understanding, and 4.2% improvement in Commonsense Reasoning. These results establish Blu-WERP as a state-of-the-art preprocessing pipeline that substantially improves LLM training data quality and downstream model performance with reduced computational cost. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on data-centric AI, demonstrating that preprocessing pipeline design significantly impacts LLM capabilities. The Blu-WERP pipeline represents a practical advancement in data quality optimization, offering researchers and practitioners an effective solution for improving LLM training efficiency and model performance.",human
"Sparse dynamics identification is an essential tool for discovering interpretable physical models and enabling efficient control in engineering systems. However, existing methods rely on batch learning with full historical data, limiting their applicability to real-time scenarios involving sequential and partially observable data. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an online Sparse Kalman Identification (SKI) method by integrating the Augmented Kalman Filter (AKF) and Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). The main contributions are: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian sparsification scheme that is seamlessly integrated into the AKF framework and adapted to sequentially collected data in online scenarios; (2) an update mechanism that adapts the Kalman posterior to reflect the updated selection of the basis functions that define the model structure; (3) an explicit gradient-descent formulation that enhances computational efficiency. Consequently, the SKI method achieves accurate model structure selection with millisecond-level efficiency and higher identification accuracy, as demonstrated by extensive simulations and real-world experiments (showing an 84.21\% improvement in accuracy over the baseline AKF).",human
"Explanation fidelity, which measures how accurately an explanation reflects a model's true reasoning, remains critically underexplored in recommender systems. We introduce SPINRec (Stochastic Path Integration for Neural Recommender Explanations), a model-agnostic approach that adapts path-integration techniques to the sparse and implicit nature of recommendation data. To overcome the limitations of prior methods, SPINRec employs stochastic baseline sampling: instead of integrating from a fixed or unrealistic baseline, it samples multiple plausible user profiles from the empirical data distribution and selects the most faithful attribution path. This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations. We conduct the most comprehensive fidelity evaluation to date across three models (MF, VAE, NCF), three datasets (ML1M, Yahoo! Music, Pinterest), and a suite of counterfactual metrics, including AUC-based perturbation curves and fixed-length diagnostics. SPINRec consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark for faithful explainability in recommendation. Code and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/DeltaLabTLV/SPINRec.",human
"Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often compromises safety alignment, even when using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA. In this work, we uncover a notable property: fine-tuned models preserve the geometric structure of their loss landscapes concerning harmful content, regardless of the fine-tuning method employed. This suggests that safety behaviors are not erased but shifted to less influential regions of the parameter space. Building on this insight, we propose a curvature-aware alignment restoration method that leverages influence functions and second-order optimization to selectively increase loss on harmful inputs while preserving task performance. By navigating the shared geometry between base and fine-tuned models, our method discourages unsafe outputs while preserving task-relevant performance, avoiding full reversion and enabling precise, low-impact updates. Extensive evaluations across multiple model families and adversarial settings show that our approach efficiently reduces harmful responses while maintaining or even improving utility and few-shot learning performance.",human
"Testing RESTful API is increasingly important in quality assurance of cloud-native applications. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance. DeepSeek excels in data type correctness and status code detection, while GPT-4o performs best in API operation coverage. For both models, LLM generated test scripts maintained 100\% syntax correctness and only required minimal manual edits for semantic correctness. These findings indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of MASTEST.",human
"The manual creation of system architecture diagrams for scientific papers is a time-consuming and subjective process, while existing generative models lack the necessary structural control and semantic understanding for this task. A primary obstacle hindering research and development in this domain has been the profound lack of a standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the automated generation of diagrams from text. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.",human
"This paper presents a real time, data driven decision support framework for epidemic control. We combine a compartmental epidemic model with sequential Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning (RL) controllers that adaptively choose intervention levels to balance disease burden, such as intensive care unit (ICU) load, against socio economic costs. We construct a context specific cost function using empirical experiments and expert feedback. We study two RL policies: an ICU threshold rule computed via Monte Carlo grid search, and a policy based on a posterior averaged Q learning agent. We validate the framework by fitting the epidemic model to publicly available ICU occupancy data from the COVID 19 pandemic in England and then generating counterfactual roll out scenarios under each RL controller, which allows us to compare the RL policies to the historical government strategy. Over a 300 day period and for a range of cost parameters, both controllers substantially reduce ICU burden relative to the observed interventions, illustrating how Bayesian sequential learning combined with RL can support the design of epidemic control policies.",human
"Many biomarker pipelines require patient-level decisions aggregated from instance-level (cell/patch) scores. Thresholds tuned on pooled instances often fail across sites due to hierarchical dependence, prevalence shift, and score-scale mismatch. We present a selection-honest framework for hierarchical thresholding that makes patient-level decisions reproducible and more defensible. At its core is a risk decomposition theorem for selection-honest thresholds. The theorem separates contributions from (i) internal fit and patient-level generalization, (ii) operating-point shift reflecting prevalence and shape changes, and (iii) a stability term that penalizes sensitivity to threshold perturbations. The stability component is computable via patient-block bootstraps mapped through a monotone modulus of risk. This framework is model-agnostic, reconciles heterogeneous decision rules on a quantile scale, and yields monotone-invariant ensembles and reportable diagnostics (e.g. flip-rate, operating-point shift).",human
"Data streams collected from multiple sources are rarely independent. Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time. Tests on two-sequence datasets show that CSDP improves the privacy-utility trade-off by approximately 50% over existing correlated-DP methods and by two orders of magnitude compared to the standard DP approach.",human
"We present a method for extracting \emph{monosemantic} neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems. Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization. Code and evaluation resources are available at https://github.com/DeltaLabTLV/Monosemanticity4Rec.",human
"This work explores Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) and Closed-form Continuous-time Networks (CfCs) for modeling retinal ganglion cell activity in tiger salamanders across three datasets. Compared to a convolutional baseline and an LSTM, both architectures achieved lower MAE, faster convergence, smaller model sizes, and favorable query times, though with slightly lower Pearson correlation. Their efficiency and adaptability make them well suited for scenarios with limited data and frequent retraining, such as edge deployments in vision prosthetics.",human
"User retention is a critical objective for online platforms like Pinterest, as it strengthens user loyalty and drives growth through repeated engagement. A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.",human
"Differentially private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has become integral to privacy-preserving machine learning, ensuring robust privacy guarantees in sensitive domains. Despite notable empirical advances leveraging features from non-private, pre-trained models to enhance DP-SGD training, a theoretical understanding of feature dynamics in private learning remains underexplored. This paper presents the first theoretical framework to analyze private training through a feature learning perspective. Building on the multi-patch data structure from prior work, our analysis distinguishes between label-dependent feature signals and label-independent noise, a critical aspect overlooked by existing analyses in the DP community. Employing a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation, we theoretically characterize both feature signal learning and data noise memorization in private training via noisy gradient descent. Our findings reveal that (1) Effective private signal learning requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to non-private training, and (2) When data noise memorization occurs in non-private learning, it will also occur in private learning, leading to poor generalization despite small training loss. Our findings highlight the challenges of private learning and prove the benefit of feature enhancement to improve SNR. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets also validate our theoretical findings.",human
"We present ContagionRL, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning platform specifically designed for systematic reward engineering in spatial epidemic simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.",human
"Coreset selection compresses large datasets into compact, representative subsets, reducing the energy and computational burden of training deep neural networks. Existing methods are either: (i) DNN-based, which are tied to model-specific parameters and introduce architectural bias; or (ii) DNN-free, which rely on heuristics lacking theoretical guarantees. Neither approach explicitly constrains distributional equivalence, largely because continuous distribution matching is considered inapplicable to discrete sampling. Moreover, prevalent metrics (e.g., MSE, KL, MMD, CE) cannot accurately capture higher-order moment discrepancies, leading to suboptimal coresets. In this work, we propose FAST, the first DNN-free distribution-matching coreset selection framework that formulates the coreset selection task as a graph-constrained optimization problem grounded in spectral graph theory and employs the Characteristic Function Distance (CFD) to capture full distributional information in the frequency domain. We further discover that naive CFD suffers from a ""vanishing phase gradient"" issue in medium and high-frequency regions; to address this, we introduce an Attenuated Phase-Decoupled CFD. Furthermore, for better convergence, we design a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy that progressively schedules frequency selection from low to high, preserving global structure before refining local details and enabling accurate matching with fewer frequencies while avoiding overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coreset selection methods across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 9.12%. Compared to other baseline coreset methods, it reduces power consumption by 96.57% and achieves a 2.2x average speedup, underscoring its high performance and energy efficiency.",human
"We study differentially private model training with stochastic gradient descent under learning rate scheduling and correlated noise. Although correlated noise, in particular via matrix factorizations, has been shown to improve accuracy, prior theoretical work focused primarily on the prefix-sum workload. That workload assumes a constant learning rate, whereas in practice learning rate schedules are widely used to accelerate training and improve convergence. We close this gap by deriving general upper and lower bounds for a broad class of learning rate schedules in both single- and multi-epoch settings. Building on these results, we propose a learning-rate-aware factorization that achieves improvements over prefix-sum factorizations under both MaxSE and MeanSE error metrics. Our theoretical analysis yields memory-efficient constructions suitable for practical deployment, and experiments on CIFAR-10 and IMDB datasets confirm that schedule-aware factorizations improve accuracy in private training.",human
"Tracking and segmentation play essential roles in video understanding, providing basic positional information and temporal association of objects within video sequences. Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.",human
"With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have drawn attention to their potential for handling not only simple question-answer tasks but also more complex conversational abilities and performing human-like behavioral imitations. In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.",human
"Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.",human
"Current methods for editing pre-trained models face significant challenges, primarily high computational costs and limited scalability. Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising solution, using simple arithmetic operations-addition and negation-based on task vectors which are the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights, to efficiently modify model behavior. However, the full potential of task arithmetic remains underexplored, primarily due to limited mechanisms for overcoming optimization stagnation. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of difference vector, a generalized form of task vectors derived from the historical movements during optimization. Using difference vectors as directed perturbations, we propose the Difference Vector-based Anisotropic Scaling Iterative algorithm (DV-BASI) to enable a continuous optimization process for task arithmetic methods without relying on any additional modules or components. Notably, by leveraging escapability and directional advantages of difference vectors, the average performance on different tasks of the multi-task model merged by DV-BASI may even outperform models individually fine-tuned. Based on this observation, we extend the application of difference vectors to a feasible fine-tuning method for single-task models. On the practical side, DV-BASI allows expressive searching directions with few learnable parameters and forms a scalable framework. We also integrate DV-BASI with task arithmetic methods and advanced optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both supervised and unsupervised evaluation protocols.",human
"Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured ""semantic sketches"" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.",human
"Clustering in stationary and nonstationary settings, where data distributions remain static or evolve over time, requires models that can adapt to distributional shifts while preserving previously learned cluster structures. This paper proposes an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based topological clustering algorithm that autonomously adjusts its recalculation interval and vigilance threshold through a diversity-driven adaptation mechanism. This mechanism enables hyperparameter-free learning that maintains cluster stability and continuity in dynamic environments. Experiments on 24 real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both clustering performance and continual learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed parameter adaptation in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent clustering in evolving data streams.

"Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are pre-trained on diverse source domains and adapted to unseen targets, enabling broad generalization for graph machine learning. Despite that GFMs have attracted considerable attention recently, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. A compromised GFM can introduce backdoor behaviors into downstream applications, posing serious security risks. However, launching backdoor attacks against GFMs is non-trivial due to three key challenges. (1) Effectiveness: Attackers lack knowledge of the downstream task during pre-training, complicating the assurance that triggers reliably induce misclassifications into desired classes. (2) Stealthiness: The variability in node features across domains complicates trigger insertion that remains stealthy. (3) Persistence: Downstream fine-tuning may erase backdoor behaviors by updating model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose GFM-BA, a novel Backdoor Attack model against Graph Foundation Models. Specifically, we first design a label-free trigger association module that links the trigger to a set of prototype embeddings, eliminating the need for knowledge about downstream tasks to perform backdoor injection. Then, we introduce a node-adaptive trigger generator, dynamically producing node-specific triggers, reducing the risk of trigger detection while reliably activating the backdoor. Lastly, we develop a persistent backdoor anchoring module that firmly anchors the backdoor to fine-tuning-insensitive parameters, enhancing the persistence of the backdoor under downstream adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and persistence of GFM-BA.",human
"Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure faces escalating cybersecurity threats that can severely compromise operational efficiency and grid stability. Existing forecasting techniques are limited by the lack of combined robust anomaly mitigation solutions and data privacy preservation. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel anomaly-resilient federated learning framework that simultaneously preserves data privacy, detects cyber-attacks, and maintains trustworthy demand prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: LSTM autoencoder-based distributed anomaly detection deployed at each federated client, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and federated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that enable collaborative learning without centralized data aggregation. The framework is validated on real-world EV charging infrastructure datasets combined with real-world DDoS attack datasets, providing robust validation of the proposed approach under realistic threat scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated approach achieves superior performance compared to centralized models, with 15.2% improvement in R2 accuracy while maintaining data locality. The integrated cyber-attack detection and mitigation system produces trustworthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability, recovering 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while maintaining exceptional precision (91.3%) and minimal false positive rates (1.21%). The proposed architecture enables enhanced EV infrastructure planning, privacy-preserving collaborative forecasting, cybersecurity resilience, and rapid recovery from malicious threats across distributed charging networks.",human
"Safety- and security-critical systems have to be thoroughly tested against their specifications. The state of practice is to have _natural language_ specifications, from which test cases are derived manually - a process that is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. _Formal_ specifications, on the other hand, are well-suited for automated test generation, but are tedious to write and maintain. In this work, we propose a two-stage pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap: First, we extract _protocol elements_ from natural-language specifications; second, leveraging a protocol implementation, we synthesize and refine a formal _protocol specification_ from these elements, which we can then use to massively test further implementations.   We see this two-stage approach to be superior to end-to-end LLM-based test generation, as 1. it produces an _inspectable specification_ that preserves traceability to the original text; 2. the generation of actual test cases _no longer requires an LLM_; 3. the resulting formal specs are _human-readable_, and can be reviewed, version-controlled, and incrementally refined; and 4. over time, we can build a _corpus_ of natural-language-to-formal-specification mappings that can be used to further train and refine LLMs for more automatic translations.   Our prototype, AUTOSPEC, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our approach on five widely used _internet protocols_ (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP, and ManageSieve) by applying its methods on their _RFC specifications_ written in natural-language, and the recent _I/O grammar_ formalism for protocol specification and fuzzing. In its evaluation, AUTOSPEC recovers on average 92.8% of client and 80.2% of server message types, and achieves 81.5% message acceptance across diverse, real-world systems.",human
"High-order tensor decomposition has been widely adopted to obtain compact deep neural networks for edge deployment. However, existing studies focus primarily on its algorithmic advantages such as accuracy and compression ratio-while overlooking the hardware deployment efficiency. Such hardware-unaware designs often obscure the potential latency and energy benefits of tensorized models. Although several works attempt to reduce computational cost by optimizing the contraction sequence based on the number of multiply-accumulate operations, they typically neglect the underlying hardware characteristics, resulting in suboptimal real-world performance. We observe that the contraction path, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping are tightly coupled and must be optimized jointly within a unified design space to maximize deployment efficiency on real devices. To this end, we propose a co-exploration framework that unifies these dimensions within a unified design space for efficient training and inference of tensorized neural networks on edge platforms. The framework formulates a latency oriented search objective and solves it via a global latency-driven exploration across the unified design space to achieve end-to-end model efficiency. The optimized configurations are implemented on a configurable FPGA kernel, achieving up to 4x and 3.85x lower inference and training latency compared with the dense baseline.",human
"State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have become powerful architectures for sequence modeling, yet their internal dynamics remain poorly understood compared to attention-based models. We introduce and validate the Influence Score, a controllability-based metric derived from the discretized state-space parameters of Mamba and computed through a backward recurrence analogous to system observability. The score quantifies how strongly a token at position k affects all later states and outputs. We evaluate this measure across three Mamba variants: mamba-130m, mamba-2.8b, and mamba-2.8b-slimpj, using six experiments that test its sensitivity to temperature, prompt complexity, token type, layer depth, token position, and input perturbations. The results show three main insights: (1) the Influence Score increases with model size and training data, reflecting model capacity; (2) Mamba exhibits consistent architectural patterns, including recency bias and concentrated influence in mid-to-late layers; and (3) emergent behaviors appear only at scale, with mamba-2.8b-slimpj uniquely prioritizing content words and reducing internal influence in the presence of noise. These findings establish the Influence Score as a practical diagnostic tool for interpreting and comparing SSM-based language models.",human
"Maintaining economic efficiency and operational reliability in microgrid energy management systems under cyberattack conditions remains challenging. Most approaches assume non-anomalous measurements, make predictions with unquantified uncertainties, and do not mitigate malicious attacks on renewable forecasts for energy management optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive cyber-resilient framework integrating federated Long Short-Term Memory-based photovoltaic forecasting with a novel two-stage cascade false data injection attack detection and energy management system optimization. The approach combines autoencoder reconstruction error with prediction uncertainty quantification to enable attack-resilient energy storage scheduling while preserving data privacy. Extreme false data attack conditions were studied that caused 58% forecast degradation and 16.9\% operational cost increases. The proposed integrated framework reduced false positive detections by 70%, recovered 93.7% of forecasting performance losses, and achieved 5\% operational cost savings, mitigating 34.7% of attack-induced economic losses. Results demonstrate that precision-focused cascade detection with multi-signal fusion outperforms single-signal approaches, validating security-performance synergy for decentralized microgrids.",human
"This paper introduces a hybrid framework for portfolio optimization that fuses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning strategy. The proposed system leverages the predictive power of deep recurrent networks to capture temporal dependencies, while the PPO agent adaptively refines portfolio allocations in continuous action spaces, allowing the system to anticipate trends while adjusting dynamically to market shifts. Using multi-asset datasets covering U.S. and Indonesian equities, U.S. Treasuries, and major cryptocurrencies from January 2018 to December 2024, the model is evaluated against several baselines, including equal-weight, index-style, and single-model variants (LSTM-only and PPO-only). The framework's performance is benchmarked against equal-weighted, index-based, and single-model approaches (LSTM-only and PPO-only) using annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics, each adjusted for transaction costs. The results indicate that the hybrid architecture delivers higher returns and stronger resilience under non-stationary market regimes, suggesting its promise as a robust, AI-driven framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.",human
"Developing a robust visual quality assessment (VQualA) large multi-modal model (LMM) requires achieving versatility, powerfulness, and transferability.   However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.",human
"As AI agents attempt to autonomously act on users' behalf, they raise transparency and control issues. We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.",human
"With the rapid rise of short-form videos, TikTok has become one of the most influential platforms among children and teenagers, but also a source of harmful content that can affect their perception and behavior. Such content, often subtle or deceptive, challenges traditional moderation methods due to the massive volume and real-time nature of uploads. This paper presents MTikGuard, a real-time multimodal harmful content detection system for TikTok, with three key contributions: (1) an extended TikHarm dataset expanded to 4,723 labeled videos by adding diverse real-world samples, (2) a multimodal classification framework integrating visual, audio, and textual features to achieve state-of-the-art performance with 89.37% accuracy and 89.45% F1-score, and (3) a scalable streaming architecture built on Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time deployment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining dataset expansion, advanced multimodal fusion, and robust deployment for practical large-scale social media content moderation.

"Incorporating spatial information, particularly those influenced by climate, weather, and demographic factors, is crucial for improving underwriting precision and enhancing risk management in insurance. However, spatial data are often unstructured, high-dimensional, and difficult to integrate into predictive models. Embedding methods are needed to convert spatial data into meaningful representations for modelling tasks. We propose a novel multi-view contrastive learning framework for generating spatial embeddings that combine information from multiple spatial data sources. To train the model, we construct a spatial dataset that merges satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap features across Europe. The framework aligns these spatial views with coordinate-based encodings, producing low-dimensional embeddings that capture both spatial structure and contextual similarity. Once trained, the model generates embeddings directly from latitude-longitude pairs, enabling any dataset with coordinates to be enriched with meaningful spatial features without requiring access to the original spatial inputs. In a case study on French real estate prices, we compare models trained on raw coordinates against those using our spatial embeddings as inputs. The embeddings consistently improve predictive accuracy across generalised linear, additive, and boosting models, while providing interpretable spatial effects and demonstrating transferability to unseen regions.",human
"Intelligent agents equipped with causal knowledge can optimize their action spaces to avoid unnecessary exploration. The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions -- observational or experimental -- and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning.",human
"Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.",human
"Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for text generation and are becoming a competitive alternative to autoregressive models. The denoising strategy plays an important role in determining the quality of their outputs. Mainstream denoising strategies include Standard Diffusion and BlockDiffusion. Standard Diffusion performs global denoising without restricting the update range, often finalizing incomplete context and causing premature end-of-sequence predictions. BlockDiffusion updates fixed-size blocks in a preset order, but its rigid structure can break apart coherent semantic units and disrupt reasoning. We present WavefrontDiffusion, a dynamic decoding approach that expands a wavefront of active tokens outward from finalized positions. This adaptive process follows the natural flow of semantic structure while keeping computational cost equal to block-based methods. Across four benchmarks in reasoning and code generation, WavefrontDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing outputs with higher semantic fidelity, showing the value of adaptive scheduling for more coherent and efficient generation.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.",human
"Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental challenge, particularly in open-domain question answering. Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty. These findings suggest that lexical coverage features provide a complementary signal for hallucination detection. All code and suffix-array infrastructure are provided at https://github.com/WWWonderer/ostd.",human
"Prefix adders are widely used in compute-intensive applications for their high speed. However, designing optimized prefix adders is challenging due to strict design rules and an exponentially large design space. We introduce PrefixGPT, a generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that directly generates optimized prefix adders from scratch. Our approach represents an adder's topology as a two-dimensional coordinate sequence and applies a legality mask during generation, ensuring every design is valid by construction. PrefixGPT features a customized decoder-only Transformer architecture. The model is first pre-trained on a corpus of randomly synthesized valid prefix adders to learn design rules and then fine-tuned to navigate the design space for optimized design quality. Compared with existing works, PrefixGPT not only finds a new optimal design with a 7.7% improved area-delay product (ADP) but exhibits superior exploration quality, lowering the average ADP by up to 79.1%. This demonstrates the potential of GPT-style models to first master complex hardware design principles and then apply them for more efficient design optimization.",human
"Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) excel at chain-of-thought reasoning but face distribution shift at test-time and a lack of verifiable supervision. Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models. Code is available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SPINE.",human
"Alignment faking is a form of strategic deception in AI in which models selectively comply with training objectives when they infer that they are in training, while preserving different behavior outside training. The phenomenon was first documented for Claude 3 Opus and later examined across additional large language models. In these setups, the word ""training"" refers to simulated training via prompts without parameter updates, so the observed effects are context conditioned shifts in behavior rather than preference learning. We study the phenomenon using an evaluation framework that compares preference optimization methods (BCO, DPO, KTO, and GRPO) across 15 models from four model families, measured along three axes: safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Our goal is to identify what causes alignment faking and when it occurs.",human
"Many deployed learning systems must update models on streaming data under memory constraints. The default strategy, sequential fine-tuning on each new phase, is architecture-agnostic but often suffers catastrophic forgetting when later phases correspond to different sub-populations or tasks. Replay with a finite buffer is a simple alternative, yet its behaviour across generative and predictive objectives is not well understood. We present a unified study of stateful replay for streaming autoencoding, time series forecasting, and classification. We view both sequential fine-tuning and replay as stochastic gradient methods for an ideal joint objective, and use a gradient alignment analysis to show when mixing current and historical samples should reduce forgetting. We then evaluate a single replay mechanism on six streaming scenarios built from Rotated MNIST, ElectricityLoadDiagrams 2011-2014, and Airlines delay data, using matched training budgets and three seeds. On heterogeneous multi task streams, replay reduces average forgetting by a factor of two to three, while on benign time based streams both methods perform similarly. These results position stateful replay as a strong and simple baseline for continual learning in streaming environments.",human
"Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.",human
"Temporal Action Detection (TAD) aims to identify and localize actions by determining their starting and ending frames within untrimmed videos. Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection. Second, it introduces a global feature fusion head that refines the detection progressively with multi-granularity features and global awareness. In addition, MambaTAD tackles TAD in an end-to-end one-stage manner using a new state-space temporal adapter(SSTA) which reduces network parameters and computation cost with linear complexity. Extensive experiments show that MambaTAD achieves superior TAD performance consistently across multiple public benchmarks.",human
"Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.",human
"Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.",human
"Foundation segmentation models such as SAM and SAM-2 perform well on natural images but struggle with brain MRIs where structures like the caudate and thalamus lack sharp boundaries and have low contrast. Rather than fine tune these models (for example MedSAM), we propose a compositional alternative where the foundation model output is treated as an additional input channel and passed alongside the MRI to highlight regions of interest.   We generate SAM-2 prompts by using a lightweight 3D U-Net that was previously trained on MRI segmentation. The U-Net may have been trained on a different dataset, so its guesses are often imprecise but usually in the correct region. The edges of the resulting foundation model guesses are smoothed to improve alignment with the MRI. We also test prompt free segmentation using DINO attention maps in the same framework.   This has-a architecture avoids modifying foundation weights and adapts to domain shift without retraining the foundation model. It reaches about 96 percent volume accuracy on basal ganglia segmentation, which is sufficient for our study of longitudinal volume change. The approach is fast, label efficient, and robust to out of distribution scans. We apply it to study inflammation linked changes in sudden onset pediatric OCD.",human
"Quantifying modality contributions in multimodal models remains a challenge, as existing approaches conflate the notion of contribution itself. Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining. This provides a principled, representation-level view of multimodal behavior, offering clearer and more interpretable insights than outcome-based metrics.",human
"Dataset distillation compresses large-scale datasets into compact, highly informative synthetic data, significantly reducing storage and training costs. However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

"The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as re-rankers is shifting recommender systems towards a user-centric paradigm. However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings.",human
"Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks due to limited multimodal reasoning data. To bridge this gap, researchers have explored methods to transfer CoT reasoning from LLMs to VLMs. However, existing approaches either need high training costs or require architectural alignment. In this paper, we use Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) to empirically show that LLMs and VLMs share similar low-frequency latent representations of CoT reasoning despite architectural differences. Based on this insight, we propose L2V-CoT, a novel training-free latent intervention approach that transfers CoT reasoning from LLMs to VLMs. L2V-CoT extracts and resamples low-frequency CoT representations from LLMs in the frequency domain, enabling dimension matching and latent injection into VLMs during inference to enhance reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms training-free baselines and even surpasses supervised methods.",human
"Chemical reasoning inherently integrates visual, textual, and symbolic modalities, yet existing benchmarks rarely capture this complexity, often relying on simple image-text pairs with limited chemical semantics. As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research.",human
"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.",human

"Animation pre-production lays the foundation of an animated film by transforming initial concepts into a coherent blueprint across interdependent stages such as ideation, scripting, design, and storyboarding. While generative AI tools are increasingly adopted in this process, they remain isolated, requiring creators to juggle multiple systems without integrated workflow support. Our formative study with 12 professional creative directors and independent animators revealed key challenges in their current practice: Creators must manually coordinate fragmented outputs, manage large volumes of information, and struggle to maintain continuity and creative control between stages. Based on the insights, we present AnimAgents, a human-multi-agent collaborative system that coordinates complex, multi-stage workflows through a core agent and specialized agents, supported by dedicated boards for the four major stages of pre-production. AnimAgents enables stage-aware orchestration, stage-specific output management, and element-level refinement, providing an end-to-end workflow tailored to professional practice. In a within-subjects summative study with 16 professional creators, AnimAgents significantly outperformed a strong single-agent baseline that equipped with advanced parallel image generation in coordination, consistency, information management, and overall satisfaction (p < .01). A field deployment with 4 creators further demonstrated AnimAgents' effectiveness in real-world projects.",human
"Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) has shown strong potential in perimeter security due to its capability of monitoring vibration events across long distances with fine spatial resolution. However, practical DFOS systems face three critical challenges: (1) signal patterns of the same activity vary drastically under different fiber deployment types (e.g., underground, wall-mounted), causing domain shift; (2) labeled data in new deployment scenarios is often scarce or entirely unavailable, limiting model adaptability; and (3) even within source domains, data scarcity makes it difficult to capture intra-class diversity for robust learning.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, DUPLE, for cross-deployment DFOS activity identification. First, a dual-domain multi-prototype learner fuses temporal and frequency domain features, enhancing the model's generalization ability under signal distribution shifts. Second, a Statistical Guided Network (SGN) infers domain importance and prototype sensitivity from raw statistical features, providing data-driven prior information for learning in unlabeled or unseen domains. Third, a query-aware prototype aggregation module adaptively selects and combines relevant prototypes, thereby improving classification performance even with limited data.   Extensive experiments on cross-deployment DFOS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain generalization settings, enabling robust event recognition across diverse fiber configurations with minimal labeled data.",human
"We develop an arbitrage-free deep learning framework for yield curve and bond price forecasting based on the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) term-structure model and a dynamic Nelson-Siegel parameterization of forward rates. Our approach embeds a no-arbitrage drift restriction into a neural state-space architecture by combining Kalman, extended Kalman, and particle filters with recurrent neural networks (LSTM/CLSTM), and introduces an explicit arbitrage error regularization (AER) term during training. The model is applied to U.S. Treasury and corporate bond data, and its performance is evaluated for both yield-space and price-space predictions at 1-day and 5-day horizons. Empirically, arbitrage regularization leads to its strongest improvements at short maturities, particularly in 5-day-ahead forecasts, increasing market-consistency as measured by bid-ask hit rates and reducing dollar-denominated prediction errors.",human
"Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.",human
"Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across multimodal tasks, yet their substantial computational demands hinder efficient deployment. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in KD and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.",human
"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, but high-resolution visual inputs result in long sequences of visual tokens and substantial inference latency. Reducing redundant visual tokens is critical to ease computational/memory burdens while preserving performance, enabling MLLM deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios. Current visual token pruning methods mainly rely on attention-based redundancy analysis and are tailored to dense architectures. We propose Fast Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (FastMMoE), a training-free acceleration framework for mixture-of-experts (MoE) based MLLMs, developed from a routing analysis perspective. FastMMoE combines two complementary strategies: (i) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation; and (ii) routing-aware token pruning that leverages similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove highly redundant visual tokens. Experiments on large-scale MoE-MLLMs such as DeepSeek-VL2 and InternVL3.5 demonstrate that FastMMoE can reduce FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of the original performance, consistently outperforming dense-model pruning baselines including FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.",human

Unlike prior black-box models, MGA-VQA introduces interpretable graph-based decision pathways and structured memory access for enhanced reasoning transparency.

"Most applications of generative AI involve a sequential interaction in which a person inputs a prompt and waits for a response, and where reaction time and adaptivity are not important factors. In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models.",human
"Associative thinking--the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas--is a foundational element of human creativity and problem-solving. This paper explores whether reinforcement learning (RL) guided by associative thinking principles can enhance a model's performance across diverse generative tasks, including story writing, code generation, and chart creation. We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that RL-based associative thinking-trained models not only generate more original and coherent stories but also exhibit improved abstraction and flexibility in tasks such as programming and data visualization. Our findings provide initial evidence that modeling cognitive creativity principles through reinforcement learning can yield more adaptive and generative AI.",human
"Embodied AI agents exploit reward signal flaws through reward hacking, achieving high proxy scores while failing true objectives. We introduce Mechanistically Interpretable Task Decomposition (MITD), a hierarchical transformer architecture with Planner, Coordinator, and Executor modules that detects and mitigates reward hacking. MITD decomposes tasks into interpretable subtasks while generating diagnostic visualizations including Attention Waterfall Diagrams and Neural Pathway Flow Charts. Experiments on 1,000 HH-RLHF samples reveal that decomposition depths of 12 to 25 steps reduce reward hacking frequency by 34 percent across four failure modes. We present new paradigms showing that mechanistically grounded decomposition offers a more effective way to detect reward hacking than post-hoc behavioral monitoring.",human
"Manufacturing processes are inherently dynamic and uncertain, with varying parameters and nonlinear behaviors, making robust control essential for maintaining quality and reliability. Traditional control methods often fail under these conditions due to their reactive nature. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a more advanced framework, leveraging process models to predict future states and optimize control actions. However, MPC relies on simplified models that often fail to capture complex dynamics, and it struggles with accurate state estimation and handling the propagation of uncertainty in manufacturing environments. Machine learning (ML) has been introduced to enhance MPC by modeling nonlinear dynamics and learning latent representations that support predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. Yet existing ML-driven MPC approaches remain deterministic and correlation-focused, motivating the exploration of generative. Generative ML offers new opportunities by learning data distributions, capturing hidden patterns, and inherently managing uncertainty, thereby complementing MPC. This review highlights five representative methods and examines how each has been integrated into MPC components, including predictive modeling, state estimation, and optimization. By synthesizing these cases, we outline the common ways generative ML can systematically enhance MPC and provide a framework for understanding its potential in diverse manufacturing processes. We identify key research gaps, propose future directions, and use a representative case to illustrate how generative ML-driven MPC can extend broadly across manufacturing. Taken together, this review positions generative ML not as an incremental add-on but as a transformative approach to reshape predictive control for next-generation manufacturing systems.",human
"Recent research has established that the impact of context in a vanilla transformer can be represented implicitly by forming a token-dependent, rank-1 patch to its MLP weights. This work extends that foundational theory to the diverse architectures of modern Large Language Models. We first demonstrate a precise, analytical solution for a Gemma-style transformer block, proving that the entire effect of a context can be perfectly mapped to rank-1 patches on its MLP weight matrices and a patch to the RMSNorm scale. We then generalize this result, providing a constructive proof and algorithm for multi-layer models. To unify these findings, we introduce a general framework centered on two core properties: input controllability and output controllability. We prove that a perfect implicit weight patch is possible for any MLP block where the inner function is input-controllable and the outer function is output-controllable. This provides a simpler and more powerful lens for understanding how transformer models transmute prompts into effective weights. This setup generalizes to a wide range of modern LLM architectures including gating, pre-/post-norm, mixture of experts and sequential/parallel transformer blocks.",human
"Conformal prediction (CP) is a general framework to quantify the predictive uncertainty of machine learning models that uses a set prediction to include the true label with a valid probability. To align the uncertainty measured by CP, conformal training methods minimize the size of the prediction sets. A typical way is to use a surrogate indicator function, usually Sigmoid or Gaussian error function. However, these surrogate functions do not have a uniform error bound to the indicator function, leading to uncontrollable learning bounds. In this paper, we propose a simple cost-sensitive conformal training algorithm that does not rely on the indicator approximation mechanism. Specifically, we theoretically show that minimizing the expected size of prediction sets is upper bounded by the expected rank of true labels. To this end, we develop a rank weighting strategy that assigns the weight using the rank of true label on each data sample. Our analysis provably demonstrates the tightness between the proposed weighted objective and the expected size of conformal prediction sets. Extensive experiments verify the validity of our theoretical insights, and superior empirical performance over other conformal training in terms of predictive efficiency with 21.38% reduction for average prediction set size.",human
"Robots must learn from both what people do and what they say, but either modality alone is often incomplete: physical corrections are grounded but ambiguous in intent, while language expresses high-level goals but lacks physical grounding. We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/MIT-CLEAR-Lab/QuickLAP.",human
"The capacity for highly complex, evidence-based, and strategically adaptive persuasion remains a formidable great challenge for artificial intelligence. Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater. We open source all code, generated speech transcripts, audio and talking head video here: https://github.com/Hellisotherpeople/DeepDebater/tree/main",human
"This paper presents a comprehensive study on enhancing kiosk systems through a low-code architecture, with a focus on AI-based implementations. Modern kiosk systems are confronted with significant challenges, including a lack of integration, structural rigidity, performance bottlenecks, and the absence of collaborative frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a DIZEST-based approach methodology, a specialized low-code platform that enables intuitive workflow design and seamless AI integration. Through a comparative analysis with existing platforms, including Jupyter Notebook, ComfyUI, and Orange3, we demonstrate that DIZEST delivers superior performance across key evaluation criteria. Our photo kiosk case study further validates the effectiveness of this approach in improving interoperability, enhancing user experience, and increasing deployment flexibility.",human
"Transformers can acquire Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities to solve complex reasoning tasks through fine-tuning. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two primary approaches to this end, yet their underlying mechanisms and differences remain theoretically unclear. In this work, we examine these aspects specifically for learning $k$-sparse Boolean functions with a one-layer transformer and intermediate supervision that is akin to CoT. In particular, we consider $k$-sparse Boolean functions that can be recursively decomposed into fixed 2-sparse Boolean functions. We analyze the learning dynamics of fine-tuning the transformer via either RL or SFT with CoT to identify sufficient conditions for it to provably learn these functions. We verify that these conditions hold for three basic examples, including $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR, thus demonstrating the learnability of both approaches. Notably, we reveal that RL and SFT exhibit distinct learning behaviors: RL learns the whole CoT chain simultaneously, whereas SFT learns the CoT chain step-by-step. Overall, our findings provide theoretical insights into the underlying mechanisms of RL and SFT as well as how they differ in triggering the CoT capabilities of transformers.",human
"We demonstrate that multipoint Bayesian algorithm execution can overcome fundamental computational challenges in storage ring design optimization. Dynamic (DA) and momentum (MA) optimization is a multipoint, multiobjective design task for storage rings, ultimately informing the flux of x-ray sources and luminosity of colliders. Current state-of-art black-box optimization methods require extensive particle-tracking simulations for each trial configuration; the high computational cost restricts the extent of the search to $\sim 10^3$ configurations, and therefore limits the quality of the final design. We remove this bottleneck using multipointBAX, which selects, simulates, and models each trial configuration at the single particle level. We demonstrate our approach on a novel design for a fourth-generation light source, with neural-network powered multipointBAX achieving equivalent Pareto front results using more than two orders of magnitude fewer tracking computations compared to genetic algorithms. The significant reduction in cost positions multipointBAX as a promising alternative to black-box optimization, and we anticipate multipointBAX will be instrumental in the design of future light sources, colliders, and large-scale scientific facilities.",human
"If AI is a foundational general-purpose technology, we should anticipate that demand for AI compute -- and energy -- will continue to grow. The Sun is by far the largest energy source in our solar system, and thus it warrants consideration how future AI infrastructure could most efficiently tap into that power. This work explores a scalable compute system for machine learning in space, using fleets of satellites equipped with solar arrays, inter-satellite links using free-space optics, and Google tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator chips. To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors. Launch costs are a critical part of overall system cost; a learning curve analysis suggests launch to low-Earth orbit (LEO) may reach $\lesssim$\$200/kg by the mid-2030s.",human
"Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a promising machine learning method for microstructure simulations such as grain growth. However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth.",human
"Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video diffusion models to add new generative controls, such as those over physical camera parameters (e.g., shutter speed or aperture), typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns these controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data. We show that not only does fine-tuning on such simple data enable the desired controls, it actually yields superior results to models fine-tuned on photorealistic ""real"" data. Beyond demonstrating these results, we provide a framework that justifies this phenomenon both intuitively and quantitatively.",human
"We introduce a graded formulation of internal symbolic computation for transformers. The hidden space is endowed with a grading $V=\bigoplus_{g\in G}V_g$, and symbolic operations are realized as typed block maps (morphisms) $φ_{h\leftarrow g}:V_g\to V_h$ that are activated selectively by a differentiable routing policy. A self-supervised \emph{graded utility functional}, defined as the loss reduction induced by a candidate morphism, governs activation and yields sparse, interpretable behavior. We develop the algebraic and geometric foundations: an internal model category whose objects are homogeneous components and whose morphisms are admissible grade transitions; adjoint pairs encoding typed round trips; and information-geometric interpretations in terms of KL gain, mirror descent with Bregman divergences, and Fisher natural gradients. Methodologically, we specify a utility--aware routing mechanism and objective that remain fully end-to-end differentiable. Analytic case studies and lightweight sanity checks illustrate selective morphic activation on hybrid symbolic-linguistic tasks. The framework unifies symbolic computation, geometry, and self--supervised learning within the \emph{graded transformer} formalism \cite{sh-89,sh-95}, while subsuming prior external-tool paradigms (e.g., Toolformer \cite{toolformer2023}) as a special case via functorial internalization.",human
"Debugging is the dominant cost in modern hardware verification, where assertion failures are among the most frequent and expensive to resolve. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution.",human
"Indoor localization using machine learning has gained traction due to the growing demand for location-based services. However, its long-term reliability is hindered by hardware/software variations across mobile devices, which shift the model's input distribution to create domain shifts. Further, evolving indoor environments can introduce new locations over time, expanding the output space to create class shifts, making static machine learning models ineffective over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified continual learning framework for indoor localization called MOELO that, for the first time, jointly addresses domain-incremental and class-incremental learning scenarios. MOELO enables a lightweight, robust, and adaptive localization solution that can be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices and is capable of continual learning in dynamic, heterogeneous real-world settings. This is made possible by a mixture-of-experts architecture, where experts are incrementally trained per region and selected through an equiangular tight frame based gating mechanism ensuring efficient routing, and low-latency inference, all within a compact model footprint. Experimental evaluations show that MOELO achieves improvements of up to 25.6x in mean localization error, 44.5x in worst-case localization error, and 21.5x lesser forgetting compared to state-of-the-art frameworks across diverse buildings, mobile devices, and learning scenarios.",human
"Foundation models hold promise for specialized medical imaging tasks, though their effectiveness in breast imaging remains underexplored. This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93). GradCAM visualizations confirmed consistent and clinically relevant attention patterns, highlighting the models interpretability and robustness. This research underscores the potential of foundation models for breast imaging applications, paving the way for future extensions for diagnostic tasks.",human
"Deterministic inference is increasingly critical for large language model (LLM) applications such as LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, multi-agent systems, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes. Also, we achieve bit-wise identical results between vLLM and FSDP in RL training pipelines with different parallel strategy. Code is available at https://github.com/nanomaoli/llm_reproducibility.",human
"An important component of the success of large AI models is double descent, in which networks avoid overfitting as they grow relative to the amount of training data, instead improving their performance on unseen data. Here we demonstrate double descent in a decentralized analog network of self-adjusting resistive elements. This system trains itself and performs tasks without a digital processor, offering potential gains in energy efficiency and speed -- but must endure component non-idealities. We find that standard training fails to yield double descent, but a modified protocol that accommodates this inherent imperfection succeeds. Our findings show that analog physical systems, if appropriately trained, can exhibit behaviors underlying the success of digital AI. Further, they suggest that biological systems might similarly benefit from over-parameterization.",human
"Clustering algorithms have long been the topic of research, representing the more popular side of unsupervised learning. Since clustering analysis is one of the best ways to find some clarity and structure within raw data, this paper explores a novel approach to \textit{k}-means clustering. Here we present a \textit{k}-means clustering algorithm that takes both the within cluster distance (WCD) and the inter cluster distance (ICD) as the distance metric to cluster the data into \emph{k} clusters pre-determined by the Calinski-Harabasz criterion in order to provide a more robust output for the clustering analysis. The idea with this approach is that by including both the measurement metrics, the convergence of the data into their clusters becomes solidified and more robust. We run the algorithm with some synthetically produced data and also some benchmark data sets obtained from the UCI repository. The results show that the convergence of the data into their respective clusters is more accurate by using both WCD and ICD measurement metrics. The algorithm is also better at clustering the outliers into their true clusters as opposed to the traditional \textit{k} means method. We also address some interesting possible research topics that reveal themselves as we answer the questions we initially set out to address.",human
"In list-decodable learning, we are given a set of data points such that an $α$-fraction of these points come from a nice distribution $D$, for some small $α\ll 1$, and the goal is to output a short list of candidate solutions, such that at least one element of this list recovers some non-trivial information about $D$. By now, there is a large body of work on this topic; however, while many algorithms can achieve optimal list size in terms of $α$, all known algorithms must incur error which decays, in some cases quite poorly, with $1 / α$. In this paper, we ask if this is inherent: is it possible to trade off list size with accuracy in list-decodable learning? More formally, given $ε> 0$, can we can output a slightly larger list in terms of $α$ and $ε$, but so that one element of this list has error at most $ε$ with the ground truth? We call this problem high-accuracy list-decodable learning. Our main result is that non-trivial high-accuracy guarantees, both information-theoretically and algorithmically, are possible for the canonical setting of list-decodable mean estimation of identity-covariance Gaussians. Specifically, we demonstrate that there exists a list of candidate means of size at most $L = \exp \left( O\left( \tfrac{\log^2 1 / α}{ε^2} \right)\right)$ so that one of the elements of this list has $\ell_2$ distance at most $ε$ to the true mean. We also design an algorithm that outputs such a list with runtime and sample complexity $n = d^{O(\log L)} + \exp \exp (\widetilde{O}(\log L))$. We do so by demonstrating a completely novel proof of identifiability, as well as a new algorithmic way of leveraging this proof without the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which may be of independent technical interest.",human
"Off-policy evaluation (OPE) estimates the value of a contextual bandit policy prior to deployment. As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based counterfactual annotations offer a scalable approach for addressing coverage limitations in healthcare datasets, enabling safer deployment of decision-making policies in clinical settings.",human
"Large language models offer opportunities to simulate multi-party deliberation, but realistic modeling remains limited by a lack of speaker-attributed data. Transcripts produced via automatic speech recognition (ASR) assign anonymous speaker labels (e.g., Speaker_1), preventing models from capturing consistent human behavior. This work introduces a reproducible pipeline to transform public Zoom recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata like persona profiles and pragmatic action tags (e.g., [propose_motion]). We release three local government deliberation datasets: Appellate Court hearings, School Board meetings, and Municipal Council sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs to model specific participants using this ""action-aware"" data produces a 67% reduction in perplexity and nearly doubles classifier-based performance metrics for speaker fidelity and realism. Turing-style human evaluations show our simulations are often indistinguishable from real deliberations, providing a practical and scalable method for complex realistic civic simulations.",human
"Flow-matching models effectively represent complex distributions, yet estimating expectations of functions of their outputs remains challenging under limited sampling budgets. Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.",human
"Large language models require significant computational resources for deployment, making quantization essential for practical applications. However, the main obstacle to effective quantization lies in systematic outliers in activations and weights, which cause substantial LLM performance degradation, especially at low-bit settings. While existing transformation-based methods like affine and rotation transformations successfully mitigate outliers, they apply the homogeneous transformation setting, i.e., using the same transformation types across all layers, ignoring the heterogeneous distribution characteristics within LLMs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive transformation selection framework that systematically determines optimal transformations on a per-layer basis. To this end, we first formulate transformation selection as a differentiable optimization problem to achieve the accurate transformation type for each layer. However, searching for optimal layer-wise transformations for every model is computationally expensive. To this end, we establish the connection between weight distribution kurtosis and accurate transformation type. Specifically, we propose an outlier-guided layer selection method using robust $z$-score normalization that achieves comparable performance to differentiable search with significantly reduced overhead. Comprehensive experiments on LLaMA family models demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently outperforms the widely-used fixed transformation settings. For example, our method achieves an improvement of up to 4.58 perplexity points and a 2.11% gain in average six-task zero-shot accuracy under aggressive W3A3K2V2 quantization settings for the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to the current best existing method, FlatQuant, demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous transformation selection for optimal LLM quantization.",human

Our study reveals how computational investment and language-specific adaptation impact performance in Portuguese, while also analyzing performance gaps in comparison to equivalent tasks in English.

"Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.",human
"Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.",human
"Radiology plays an integral role in modern medicine, yet rising imaging volumes have far outpaced workforce growth. Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs from a large academic center, together with RATE, a scalable framework that extracts structured labels for 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breast MRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving mean AUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperforming MedGemma (Google), MedImageInsight (Microsoft), Lingshu (Alibaba), and Merlin (Stanford) by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points and ranking best in 87.2\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a >95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline. Pillar-0 and RATE together provide an open, clinically rigorous foundation for building high-performance radiology systems, enabling applications that were previously infeasible due to computational, data, and evaluation constraints.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, but their massive parameter counts create substantial computational and memory challenges during deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges with minimal overhead. While existing PTQ methods can effectively quantize LLMs, they experience substantial accuracy loss at extremely low bit-widths, primarily due to high-impact parameters that significantly influence quantization performance. Several approaches address these issues by identifying and retaining the high-impact parameters in FP16 format. However, they apply fixed ratios of high-impact parameters across all layers, overlooking layer-wise sensitivity variations. In this paper, we propose a quadratic optimization framework that determines layer-specific ratios of high-impact parameters while considering inter-layer dependencies. We quantize high-impact parameters to moderate bit-widths, which often result in negligible performance degradation in quantized LLMs, while the remaining parameters can be quantized to extremely low bit-widths. Under the same resource-constrained budget, this allows for preserving more high-impact parameters than methods that keep selecting a few in FP16 format. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to leverage an advanced quantization method that often requires extensive learnable parameters solely for high-impact parameters, while applying a computationally efficient method to the rest. Our approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy while maintaining high performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",human
"Multi-label feature selection (FS) reduces the dimensionality of multi-label data by removing irrelevant, noisy, and redundant features, thereby boosting the performance of multi-label learning models. However, existing methods typically require centralized data, which makes them unsuitable for distributed and federated environments where each device/client holds its own local dataset. Additionally, federated methods often assume that clients have labeled data, which is unrealistic in cases where clients lack the expertise or resources to label task-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose a Semi-Supervised Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection method, called SSFMLFS, where clients hold only unlabeled data, while the server has limited labeled data. SSFMLFS adapts fuzzy information theory to a federated setting, where clients compute fuzzy similarity matrices and transmit them to the server, which then calculates feature redundancy and feature-label relevancy degrees. A feature graph is constructed by modeling features as vertices, assigning relevancy and redundancy degrees as vertex weights and edge weights, respectively. PageRank is then applied to rank the features by importance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from various domains, including biology, images, music, and text, demonstrate that SSFMLFS outperforms other federated and centralized supervised and semi-supervised approaches in terms of three different evaluation metrics in non-IID data distribution setting.",human
"Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) rely on effective multimodal alignment between pre-trained vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate visual and textual information. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability ""look"" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination. We validate our approach across different vision-centric benchmarks where our method is better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research aimed at achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs.",human
"Digital computers are power-hungry and largely intolerant of damaged components, making them potentially difficult tools for energy-limited autonomous agents in uncertain environments. Recently developed Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) - analog networks of self-adjusting nonlinear resistors - are inherently low-power and robust to physical damage, but were constructed to perform supervised learning. In this work we demonstrate success on two simple RL problems using Q-learning adapted for simulated CLLNs. Doing so makes explicit the components (beyond the network being trained) required to enact various tools in the RL toolbox, some of which (policy function and value function) are more natural in this system than others (replay buffer). We discuss assumptions such as the physical safety that digital hardware requires, CLLNs can forgo, and biological systems cannot rely on, and highlight secondary goals that are important in biology and trainable in CLLNs, but make little sense in digital computers.",human
"Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices are widely used in microfluidics for label-free, size-based separation of particles and cells, with particular promise in isolating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for early cancer diagnostics. This study focuses on the optimization of DLD design parameters, such as row shift fraction, post size, and gap distance, to enhance the selective isolation of lung cancer cells based on their physical properties. To overcome the challenges of rare CTC detection and reduce reliance on computationally intensive simulations, machine learning models including gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressors are employed. Trained on a large, numerically validated dataset, these models predict particle trajectories and identify optimal device configurations, enabling high-throughput and cost-effective DLD design. Beyond trajectory prediction, the models aid in isolating critical design variables, offering a systematic, data-driven framework for automated DLD optimization. This integrative approach advances the development of scalable and precise microfluidic systems for cancer diagnostics, contributing to the broader goals of early detection and personalized medicine.",human
"Verifying uniform conditions over continuous spaces through random sampling is fundamental in machine learning and control theory, yet classical coverage analyses often yield conservative bounds, particularly at small failure probabilities. We study uniform random sampling on the $d$-dimensional unit hypercube and analyze the number of uncovered subcubes after discretization. By applying a concentration inequality to the uncovered-count statistic, we derive a sample complexity bound with a logarithmic dependence on the failure probability ($δ$), i.e., $M =O( \tilde{C}\ln(\frac{2\tilde{C}}δ))$, which contrasts sharply with the classical linear $1/δ$ dependence. Under standard Lipschitz and uniformity assumptions, we present a self-contained derivation and compare our result with classical coupon-collector rates. Numerical studies across dimensions, precision levels, and confidence targets indicate that our bound tracks practical coverage requirements more tightly and scales favorably as $δ\to 0$. Our findings offer a sharper theoretical tool for algorithms that rely on grid-based coverage guarantees, enabling more efficient sampling, especially in high-confidence regimes.",human
"Node popularity is recognized as a key factor in modeling real-world networks, capturing heterogeneity in connectivity across communities. This concept is equally important in bipartite networks, where nodes in different partitions may exhibit varying popularity patterns, motivating models such as the Two-Way Node Popularity Model (TNPM). Existing methods, such as the Two-Stage Divided Cosine (TSDC) algorithm, provide a scalable estimation approach but may have limitations in terms of accuracy or applicability across different types of networks. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient and theoretically justified variational expectation-maximization (VEM) framework for the TNPM. We establish label consistency for the estimated community assignments produced by the proposed variational estimator in bipartite networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our method achieves superior estimation accuracy across a range of bipartite as well as undirected networks compared to existing algorithms. Finally, we evaluate our method on real-world bipartite and undirected networks, further demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness.",human
"Agnostic learning of Boolean halfspaces is a fundamental problem in computational learning theory, but it is known to be computationally hard even for weak learning. Recent work [CKKMK24] proposed smoothed analysis as a way to bypass such hardness, but existing frameworks rely on additive Gaussian perturbations, making them unsuitable for discrete domains. We introduce a new smoothed agnostic learning framework for Boolean inputs, where perturbations are modeled via random bit flips. This defines a natural discrete analogue of smoothed optimality generalizing the Gaussian case. Under strictly subexponential assumptions on the input distribution, we give an efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in this model, with runtime and sample complexity approximately n raised to a poly(1/(sigma * epsilon)) factor. Previously, such algorithms were known only with strong structural assumptions for the discrete hypercube, for example, independent coordinates or symmetric distributions. Our result provides the first computationally efficient guarantee for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces over the Boolean hypercube, bridging the gap between worst-case intractability and practical learnability in discrete settings.",human
"We present PrismSSL, a Python library that unifies state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) methods across audio, vision, graphs, and cross-modal settings in a single, modular codebase. The goal of the demo is to show how researchers and practitioners can: (i) install, configure, and run pretext training with a few lines of code; (ii) reproduce compact benchmarks; and (iii) extend the framework with new modalities or methods through clean trainer and dataset abstractions. PrismSSL is packaged on PyPI, released under the MIT license, integrates tightly with HuggingFace Transformers, and provides quality-of-life features such as distributed training in PyTorch, Optuna-based hyperparameter search, LoRA fine-tuning for Transformer backbones, animated embedding visualizations for sanity checks, Weights & Biases logging, and colorful, structured terminal logs for improved usability and clarity. In addition, PrismSSL offers a graphical dashboard - built with Flask and standard web technologies - that enables users to configure and launch training pipelines with minimal coding. The artifact (code and data recipes) will be publicly available and reproducible.",human
"Agentic frameworks powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can be useful tools in scientific workflows by enabling human-AI co-creation. A key challenge is recommending the next steps during workflow creation without relying solely on LLMs, which risk hallucination and require fine-tuning with scarce proprietary data. We propose an episodic memory architecture that stores and retrieves past workflows to guide agents in suggesting plausible next tasks. By matching current workflows with historical sequences, agents can recommend steps based on prior patterns.",human
"Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Niño data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.",human
"Nano-UAV teams offer great agility yet face severe navigation challenges due to constrained onboard sensing, communication, and computation. Existing approaches rely on high-resolution vision or compute-intensive planners, rendering them infeasible for these platforms. We introduce LEARN, a lightweight, two-stage safety-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework for multi-UAV navigation in cluttered spaces. Our system combines low-resolution Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and a simple motion planner with a compact, attention-based RL policy. In simulation, LEARN outperforms two state-of-the-art planners by $10\%$ while using substantially fewer resources. We demonstrate LEARN's viability on six Crazyflie quadrotors, achieving fully onboard flight in diverse indoor and outdoor environments at speeds up to $2.0 m/s$ and traversing $0.2 m$ gaps.",human
"Efficiently and meaningfully estimating prediction uncertainty is important for exploration in active learning campaigns in materials discovery, where samples with high uncertainty are interpreted as containing information missing from the model. In this work, the effect of different uncertainty estimation and calibration methods are evaluated for active learning when using ensembles of ALIGNN, eXtreme Gradient Boost, Random Forest, and Neural Network model architectures. We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone. Analysis of the target, in-distribution uncertainty, out-of-distribution uncertainty, and training residual distributions suggest that future work focus on understanding empirical uncertainties in the feature input space for cases where ensemble prediction variances do not accurately capture the missing information required for the model to generalize.",human
"Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices enable liquid biopsy for cancer detection by separating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples based on size, but designing these microfluidic devices requires computationally expensive Navier-Stokes simulations and particle-tracing analyses. While recent surrogate modeling approaches using deep learning have accelerated this process, they often inadequately handle the critical periodic boundary conditions of DLD unit cells, leading to cumulative errors in multi-unit device predictions. This paper introduces a periodicity-enforced surrogate modeling approach that incorporates periodic layers, neural network components that guarantee exact periodicity without penalty terms or output modifications, into deep learning architectures for DLD device design. The proposed method employs three sub-networks to predict steady-state, non-dimensional velocity and pressure fields (u, v, p) rather than directly predicting critical diameters or particle trajectories, enabling complete flow field characterization and enhanced design flexibility. Periodic layers ensure exact matching of flow variables across unit cell boundaries through architectural enforcement rather than soft penalty-based approaches. Validation on 120 CFD-generated geometries demonstrates that the periodic layer implementation achieves 0.478% critical diameter error while maintaining perfect periodicity consistency, representing an 85.4% improvement over baseline methods. The approach enables efficient and accurate DLD device design with guaranteed boundary condition satisfaction for multi-unit device applications.",human
"Ab initio quantum chemical methods for accurately computing interactions between molecules have a wide range of applications but are often computationally expensive. Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $Δ$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $Δ$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $Δ$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory.",human
"Approximating training-point influence on test predictions is critical for deploying deep-learning vision models, essential for locating noisy data. Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\% accuracy in the top 1\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\% asym), and gets 99.8\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.",human
"Nowadays, social networks are becoming a popular way of analyzing tourist behavior, thanks to the digital traces left by travelers during their stays on these networks. The massive amount of data generated; by the propensity of tourists to share comments and photos during their trip; makes it possible to model their journeys and analyze their behavior. Predicting the next movement of tourists plays a key role in tourism marketing to understand demand and improve decision support. In this paper, we propose a method to understand and to learn tourists' movements based on social network data analysis to predict future movements. The method relies on a machine learning grammatical inference algorithm. A major contribution in this paper is to adapt the grammatical inference algorithm to the context of big data. Our method produces a hidden Markov model representing the movements of a group of tourists. The hidden Markov model is flexible and editable with new data. The capital city of France, Paris is selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.",human
"The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars, particularly those utilizing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, introduces new risks of online identity theft, especially in systems that rely on biometric authentication. While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.",human
"Computational approaches have previously shown various promises and pitfalls when it comes to the reliable identification of media frames. Generative LLMs like GPT and Claude are increasingly being used as content analytical tools, but how effective are they for frame analysis? We address this question by systematically evaluating them against their computational predecessors: bag-of-words models and encoder-only transformers; and traditional manual coding procedures. Our analysis rests on a novel gold standard dataset that we inductively and iteratively developed through the study, investigating six months of news coverage of the US Mpox epidemic of 2022. While we discover some potential applications for generative LLMs, we demonstrate that they were consistently outperformed by manual coders, and in some instances, by smaller language models. Some form of human validation was always necessary to determine appropriate model choice. Additionally, by examining how the suitability of various approaches depended on the nature of different tasks that were part of our frame analytical workflow, we provide insights as to how researchers may leverage the complementarity of these approaches to use them in tandem. We conclude by endorsing a methodologically pluralistic approach and put forth a roadmap for computational frame analysis for researchers going forward.",human
"This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.",human
"We prove that a denoising diffusion sampler equipped with a sequential bias across the batch dimension is exactly an Euler-Maruyama integrator for overdamped Langevin dynamics. Each reverse denoising step, with its associated spring stiffness, can be interpreted as one step of a stochastic differential equation with an effective time step set jointly by the noise schedule and that stiffness. The learned score then plays the role of the drift, equivalently the gradient of a learned energy, yielding a precise correspondence between diffusion sampling and Langevin time evolution.   This equivalence recasts molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of diffusion models. Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy.   We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations.",human
"SOCs and CSIRTs face increasing pressure to automate incident categorization, yet the use of cloud-based LLMs introduces costs, latency, and confidentiality risks. We investigate whether locally executed SLMs can meet this challenge. We evaluated 21 models ranging from 1B to 20B parameters, varying the temperature hyperparameter and measuring execution time and precision across two distinct architectures. The results indicate that temperature has little influence on performance, whereas the number of parameters and GPU capacity are decisive factors.",human
"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven remarkably effective for eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities. We envision VisReason as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning, paving the way toward the next generation of multimodal intelligence.",human
"We present M^3-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal tool use under the Model Context Protocol. The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

"Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability.   This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions.   We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.",human
"Data assimilation is a fundamental task in updating forecasting models upon observing new data, with applications ranging from weather prediction to online reinforcement learning. Deep generative forecasting models (DGFMs) have shown excellent performance in these areas, but assimilating data into such models is challenging due to their intractable likelihood functions. This limitation restricts the use of standard Bayesian data assimilation methodologies for DGFMs. To overcome this, we introduce prequential posteriors, based upon a predictive-sequential (prequential) loss function; an approach naturally suited for temporally dependent data which is the focus of forecasting tasks. Since the true data-generating process often lies outside the assumed model class, we adopt an alternative notion of consistency and prove that, under mild conditions, both the prequential loss minimizer and the prequential posterior concentrate around parameters with optimal predictive performance. For scalable inference, we employ easily parallelizable wastefree sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers with preconditioned gradient-based kernels, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces such as those in DGFMs. We validate our method on both a synthetic multi-dimensional time series and a real-world meteorological dataset; highlighting its practical utility for data assimilation for complex dynamical systems.",human
"Standard decision frameworks addresses uncertainty about facts but assumes fixed values. We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yields Pareto-improving Nash bargains. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement and its associated benefits. By unifying epistemic and axiological refinement under a single formalism, we broaden the conceptual foundations of rational choice and illuminate the normative status of ethical deliberation.",human
"This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.",human
"It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.",human
"This study proposes a Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)-enhanced quantum kernel for short-term time-series forecasting. Each signal is windowed, amplitude-encoded, transformed by a QFT, then passed through a protective rotation layer to avoid the QFT/QFT adjoint cancellation; the resulting kernel is used in kernel ridge regression (KRR). Exogenous predictors are incorporated by convexly fusing feature-specific kernels. On multi-station solar irradiance data across Koppen climate classes, the proposed kernel consistently improves median R2 and nRMSE over reference classical RBF and polynomials kernels, while also reducing bias (nMBE); complementary MAE/ERMAX analyses indicate tighter average errors with remaining headroom under sharp transients. For both quantum and classical models, the only tuned quantities are the feature-mixing weights and the KRR ridge alpha; classical hyperparameters (gamma, r, d) are fixed, with the same validation set size for all models. Experiments are conducted on a noiseless simulator (5 qubits; window length L=32). Limitations and ablations are discussed, and paths toward NISQ execution are outlined.",human
"Recent advances in multimodal deep learning have greatly enhanced the capability of systems for speech analysis and pronunciation assessment. Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Quranic recitation, where subtle phonetic differences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings extracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, intermediate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29 Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a detailed comparison of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection. The study contributes to the development of intelligent, speaker-independent, and multimodal Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems, offering a practical step toward technology-supported Quranic pronunciation training and broader speech-based educational applications.",human
"Neural network subgrid stress models often have a priori performance that is far better than the a posteriori performance, leading to neural network models that look very promising a priori completely failing in a posteriori Large Eddy Simulations (LES). This performance gap can be decreased by combining two different methods, training data augmentation and reducing input complexity to the neural network. Augmenting the training data with two different filters before training the neural networks has no performance degradation a priori as compared to a neural network trained with one filter. A posteriori, neural networks trained with two different filters are far more robust across two different LES codes with different numerical schemes. In addition, by ablating away the higher order terms input into the neural network, the a priori versus a posteriori performance changes become less apparent. When combined, neural networks that use both training data augmentation and a less complex set of inputs have a posteriori performance far more reflective of their a priori evaluation.",human
"Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via ""masked-then-fill"" and ""step reordering"" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.",human
"We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's ""persona"" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

"Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.",human
"Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.",human
"Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.",human
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied to creative domains, leading to the development of systems that collaborate with humans in design processes. In Graphic Design, integrating computational systems into co-creative workflows presents specific challenges, as it requires balancing scientific rigour with the subjective and visual nature of design practice. Following the PRISMA methodology, we identified 872 articles, resulting in a final corpus of 71 publications describing 68 unique systems. Based on this review, we introduce GRAPHIC (Guidelines for Reviewing Algorithmic Practices in Human-centred Design and Interaction for Creativity), a framework for analysing computational systems applied to Graphic Design. Its goal is to understand how current systems support human-AI collaboration in the Graphic Design discipline. The framework comprises main dimensions, which our analysis revealed to be essential across diverse system types: (1) Collaborative Panorama, (2) Processes and Modalities, and (3) Graphic Design Principles. Its application revealed research gaps, including the need to balance initiative and control between agents, improve communication through explainable interaction models, and promote systems that support transformational creativity grounded in core design principles.",human
"Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.",human
"Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.",human
"We consider the adaptive control problem for discrete-time, nonlinear stochastic systems with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming access to a parameterised family of controllers that can stabilise the system in a bounded set within an informative region of the state space when the parameter is well-chosen, we propose a certainty equivalence learning-based adaptive control strategy, and subsequently derive stability bounds on the closed-loop system that hold for some probabilities. We then show that if the entire state space is informative, and the family of controllers is globally stabilising with appropriately chosen parameters, high probability stability guarantees can be derived.",human
"This paper addresses the cooperative Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Stochastic Requests (MVDPDPSR) and proposes an end-to-end centralized decision-making framework based on sequence-to-sequence, named Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer (MAPT). MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.",human
"Traditional evaluation metrics for textual and visual question answering, like ROUGE, METEOR, and Exact Match (EM), focus heavily on n-gram based lexical similarity, often missing the deeper semantic understanding needed for accurate assessment. While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.",human
"Mastering one or more programming languages has historically been the gateway to implementing ideas on a computer. Today, that gateway is widening with advances in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants. What matters is no longer just fluency in traditional programming languages but the ability to think computationally by translating problems into forms that can be solved with computing tools. The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI.   This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results?   This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education.",human
"We present a differentiable extension of the VEROS ocean model, enabling automatic differentiation through its dynamical core. We describe the key modifications required to make the model fully compatible with JAX autodifferentiation framework and evaluate the numerical consistency of the resulting implementation. Two illustrative applications are then demonstrated: (i) the correction of an initial ocean state through gradient-based optimization, and (ii) the calibration of unknown physical parameters directly from model observations. These examples highlight how differentiable programming can facilitate end-to-end learning and parameter tuning in ocean modeling. Our implementation is available online.",human
"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.",human
"Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.",human
"Graph representation learning seeks to transform complex, high-dimensional graph structures into compact vector spaces that preserve both topology and semantics. Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.",human
"The rapid evolution of the telecommunication industry necessitates efficient troubleshooting processes to maintain network reliability, software maintainability, and service quality. Trouble Reports (TRs), which document issues in Ericsson's production system, play a critical role in facilitating the timely resolution of software faults. However, the complexity and volume of TR data, along with the presence of diverse criteria that reflect different aspects of each fault, present challenges for retrieval systems. Building on prior work at Ericsson, which utilized a two-stage workflow, comprising Initial Retrieval (IR) and Re-Ranking (RR) stages, this study investigates different TR observation criteria and their impact on the performance of retrieval models. We propose \textbf{CREST} (\textbf{C}riteria-specific \textbf{R}etrieval via \textbf{E}nsemble of \textbf{S}pecialized \textbf{T}R models), a criterion-driven retrieval approach that leverages specialized models for different TR fields to improve both effectiveness and interpretability, thereby enabling quicker fault resolution and supporting software maintenance. CREST utilizes specialized models trained on specific TR criteria and aggregates their outputs to capture diverse and complementary signals. This approach leads to enhanced retrieval accuracy, better calibration of predicted scores, and improved interpretability by providing relevance scores for each criterion, helping users understand why specific TRs were retrieved. Using a subset of Ericsson's internal TRs, this research demonstrates that criterion-specific models significantly outperform a single model approach across key evaluation metrics. This highlights the importance of all targeted criteria used in this study for optimizing the performance of retrieval systems.",human
"Robotic Foundation Models (RFMs) hold great promise as generalist, end-to-end systems for robot control. Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\times$ fewer robot demonstrations. This carefully-engineered training strategy unlocks new VLM capabilities and as a consequence boosts the reliability of embodied control beyond what is achievable with only robotic data. We make our model weights and 3D-annotated datasets publicly available.",human
"Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.",human
"Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.",human
"Linguistic features remain essential for interpretability and tasks involving style, structure, and readability, but existing Spanish tools offer limited coverage.

PUCP-Metrix enables fine-grained, interpretable text analysis. We evaluate its usefulness on Automated Readability Assessment and Machine-Generated Text Detection, showing competitive performance compared to an existing repository and strong neural baselines. PUCP-Metrix offers a comprehensive, extensible resource for Spanish, supporting diverse NLP applications.",human
"Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: ""Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?"". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.",human
"As deep learning models continue to scale, the growing computational demands have amplified the need for effective coreset selection techniques. Coreset selection aims to accelerate training by identifying small, representative subsets of data that approximate the performance of the full dataset. Among various approaches, gradient based methods stand out due to their strong theoretical underpinnings and practical benefits, particularly under limited data budgets. However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.   In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations. First, we establish a connection between posterior sampling and loss landscapes, enabling robust coreset selection even in high data corruption scenarios. Second, we introduce a smoothed loss function based on posterior sampling onto the model weights, enhancing stability and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. We also present a novel convergence analysis for our sampling-based coreset selection method. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our approach achieves faster training and enhanced generalization across diverse datasets than the current state of the art.",human
"Face verification is a significant component of identity authentication in various applications including online banking and secure access to personal devices. The majority of the existing face image datasets often suffer from notable biases related to race, gender, and other demographic characteristics, limiting the effectiveness and fairness of face verification systems. In response to these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced generative models to create varied and diverse high-quality synthetic face images. This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies",human
"Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.",human
"Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.",human
"Understanding the dynamics of optimization in deep learning is increasingly important as models scale. While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants reliably find solutions that generalize well, the mechanisms driving this generalization remain unclear. Notably, these algorithms often prefer flatter or simpler minima, particularly in overparameterized settings. Prior work has linked flatness to generalization, and methods like Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) explicitly encourage flatness, but a unified theory connecting data structure, optimization dynamics, and the nature of learned solutions is still lacking. In this work, we develop a linear stability framework that analyzes the behavior of SGD, random perturbations, and SAM, particularly in two layer ReLU networks. Central to our analysis is a coherence measure that quantifies how gradient curvature aligns across data points, revealing why certain minima are stable and favored during training.",human
"Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum computing and quantum autoencoders. In this paper, we propose quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) that can effectively learn missing features of a data sample within quantum states instead of classical embeddings. We showcase that our QMAE architecture can learn the masked features of an image and can reconstruct the masked input image with improved visual fidelity in MNIST images. Experimental evaluation highlights that QMAE can significantly outperform (12.86% on average) in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders in the presence of masks.",human
"Computing worst-case robust strategies in pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) is time-consuming, especially when real-world factors like partial observability are considered. While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.",human
"We propose a zero-shot method for Natural Language Inference (NLI) that leverages multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts. Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.",human
"Transformer-based models have dramatically increased their size and parameter count to tackle increasingly complex tasks. At the same time, there is a growing demand for low-latency inference on resource-constrained devices that achieves high performance. In particular, stream data inference is typically performed over a sliding temporal window, leading to highly redundant computations. The recent Continual Transformers have addressed this issue, but they can only be effectively used in shallow models, which limits their scope and generalization power. In this paper, we propose the Deep Continual Transformer (DeepCoT), a redundancy-free encoder-only model that can be applied over existing deep encoder architectures with minimal changes. In our experiments over audio, video, and text streams, we show that DeepCoTs retain comparative performance to their non-continual baselines while offering a linear computational cost for all Transformer layers, which reduces up to two orders of magnitude in the running time compared to previous efficient models.",human
"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning promises, among other benefits, to efficiently capture and utilize the temporal structure of a decision-making problem and to enhance continual learning capabilities, but theoretical guarantees lag behind practice. In this paper, we propose a Feudal Q-learning scheme and investigate under which conditions its coupled updates converge and are stable. By leveraging the theory of Stochastic Approximation and the ODE method, we present a theorem stating the convergence and stability properties of Feudal Q-learning. This provides a principled convergence and stability analysis tailored to Feudal RL. Moreover, we show that the updates converge to a point that can be interpreted as an equilibrium of a suitably defined game, opening the door to game-theoretic approaches to Hierarchical RL. Lastly, experiments based on the Feudal Q-learning algorithm support the outcomes anticipated by theory.",human
"Prompt learning has emerged as an effective technique for fine-tuning large-scale foundation models for downstream tasks. However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.",human
"We present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block. Although our findings challenge standard theories of Mandarin tone, they fit well within the theoretical framework of the Discriminative Lexicon Model.",human
"Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.",human
"Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.",human
"According to the theory of International Political Economy (IPE), states are often incentivized to rely on rather than constrain powerful corporations. For this reason, IPE provides a useful lens to explain why efforts to govern Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the international and national levels have thus far been developed, applied, and enforced unevenly. Building on recent work that explores how AI companies engage in geopolitics, this position paper argues that some AI workers can be considered actors of geopolitics. It makes the timely case that governance alone cannot ensure responsible, ethical, or robust AI development and use, and greater attention should be paid to bottom-up interventions at the site of AI development. AI workers themselves should be situated as individual agents of change, especially when considering their potential to foster Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA). Drawing on methods of Participatory Design (PD), this paper proposes engaging AI workers as sources of knowledge, relative power, and intentionality to encourage more responsible and just AI development and create the conditions that can facilitate ACA.",human
"Recent advances in generative AI have made music generation a prominent research focus. However, many neural-based models rely on large datasets, raising concerns about copyright infringement and high-performance costs. In contrast, we propose MusicAIR, an innovative multimodal AI music generation framework powered by a novel algorithm-driven symbolic music core, effectively mitigating copyright infringement risks. The music core algorithms connect critical lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features, creating a complete, coherent melodic score solely from the lyrics. The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions. As a co-pilot tool, GenAIM can serve as a reliable music composition assistant and a possible educational composition tutor while simultaneously lowering the entry barrier for all aspiring musicians, which is innovative and significantly contributes to AI for music generation.",human
"We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.",human
"Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.   We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.",human
"Ultrafast electron beam X-ray computed tomography produces noisy data due to short measurement times, causing reconstruction artifacts and limiting overall image quality. To counteract these issues, two self-supervised deep learning methods for denoising of raw detector data were investigated and compared against a non-learning based denoising method. We found that the application of the deep-learning-based methods was able to enhance signal-to-noise ratios in the detector data and also led to consistent improvements of the reconstructed images, outperforming the non-learning based method.",human
"Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.",human
"Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.",human
"Our work introduces SAVeD (Semantically Aware Version Detection), a contrastive learning-based framework for identifying versions of structured datasets without relying on metadata, labels, or integration-based assumptions. SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions. Compared to untrained baselines and prior state-of-the-art dataset-discovery methods like Starmie, our custom encoder achieves competitive or superior results.",human
"The physics programs of current and future collider experiments necessitate the development of surrogate simulators for calorimeter showers. While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.",human
"In this paper, we present a localized and culturally adapted Estonian translation of the test set from the widely used commonsense reasoning benchmark, WinoGrande. We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.",human
"Smart grid technological advances present a recent class of complex interdisciplinary modeling and increasingly difficult simulation problems to solve using traditional computational methods. To simulate a smart grid requires a systemic approach to integrated modeling of power systems, energy markets, demand-side management, and much other resources and assets that are becoming part of the current paradigm of the power grid. This paper presents a backbone model of a smart grid to test alternative scenarios for the grid. This tool simulates disparate systems to validate assumptions before the human scale model. Thanks to a distributed optimization of subsystems, the production and consumption scheduling is achieved while maintaining flexibility and scalability.",human
"Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.",human
"This paper presents an efficient approach for determining the joint configuration of a multifingered gripper solely from the point cloud data of its poly-articulated chain, as generated by visual sensors, simulations or even generative neural networks. Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning.",human
"Premium automotive manufacturers face increasingly complex forecasting challenges due to high product variety, sparse variant-level data, and volatile market dynamics. This study addresses monthly automobile demand forecasting across a multi-product, multi-market, and multi-level hierarchy using data from a German premium manufacturer. The methodology combines point and probabilistic forecasts across strategic and operational planning levels, leveraging ensembles of LightGBM models with pooled training sets, quantile regression, and a mixed-integer linear programming reconciliation approach. Results highlight that spatiotemporal dependencies, as well as rounding bias, significantly affect forecast accuracy, underscoring the importance of integer forecasts for operational feasibility. Shapley analysis shows that short-term demand is reactive, shaped by life cycle maturity, autoregressive momentum, and operational signals, whereas medium-term demand reflects anticipatory drivers such as online engagement, planning targets, and competitive indicators, with online behavioral data considerably improving accuracy at disaggregated levels.",human
"Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.",human
"The rapid expansion of scholarly literature presents significant challenges in synthesizing comprehensive, high-quality academic surveys. Recent advancements in agentic systems offer considerable promise for automating tasks that traditionally require human expertise, including literature review, synthesis, and iterative refinement. However, existing automated survey-generation solutions often suffer from inadequate quality control, poor formatting, and limited adaptability to iterative feedback, which are core elements intrinsic to scholarly writing.   To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE, an Agentic Rubric-guided Iterative Survey Engine designed for automated generation and continuous refinement of academic survey papers. ARISE employs a modular architecture composed of specialized large language model agents, each mirroring distinct scholarly roles such as topic expansion, citation curation, literature summarization, manuscript drafting, and peer-review-based evaluation. Central to ARISE is a rubric-guided iterative refinement loop in which multiple reviewer agents independently assess manuscript drafts using a structured, behaviorally anchored rubric, systematically enhancing the content through synthesized feedback.   Evaluating ARISE against state-of-the-art automated systems and recent human-written surveys, our experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving an average rubric-aligned quality score of 92.48. ARISE consistently surpasses baseline methods across metrics of comprehensiveness, accuracy, formatting, and overall scholarly rigor.

"Nowadays, we are witnessing an Artificial Intelligence revolution that dominates the technology landscape in various application domains, such as healthcare, robotics, automotive, security, and defense. Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology. Therefore, DISCA significantly improves the energy efficiency for matrix multiplication workloads by orders of magnitude if scaled and compared to its counterpart architectures.",human
"Neural PDE solvers used for scientific simulation often violate governing equation constraints. While linear constraints can be projected cheaply, many constraints are nonlinear, complicating projection onto the feasible set. Dynamical PDEs are especially difficult because constraints induce long-range dependencies in time. In this work, we evaluate two training-free, post hoc projections of approximate solutions: a nonlinear optimization-based projection, and a local linearization-based projection using Jacobian-vector and vector-Jacobian products. We analyze constraints across representative PDEs and find that both projections substantially reduce violations and improve accuracy over physics-informed baselines.",human
"As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly influence high-stakes decision-making across global contexts, ensuring their alignment with diverse cultural values has become a critical governance challenge. This study presents a Multi-Layered Auditing Platform for Responsible AI that systematically evaluates cross-cultural value alignment in China-origin and Western-origin LLMs through four integrated methodologies: Ethical Dilemma Corpus for assessing temporal stability, Diversity-Enhanced Framework (DEF) for quantifying cultural fidelity, First-Token Probability Alignment for distributional accuracy, and Multi-stAge Reasoning frameworK (MARK) for interpretable decision-making. Our comparative analysis of 20+ leading models, such as Qwen, GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, reveals universal challenges-fundamental instability in value systems, systematic under-representation of younger demographics, and non-linear relationships between model scale and alignment quality-alongside divergent regional development trajectories. While China-origin models increasingly emphasize multilingual data integration for context-specific optimization, Western models demonstrate greater architectural experimentation but persistent U.S.-centric biases. Neither paradigm achieves robust cross-cultural generalization. We establish that Mistral-series architectures significantly outperform LLaMA3-series in cross-cultural alignment, and that Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning on diverse datasets surpasses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback in preserving cultural variation...",human
"Adversarial attacks introduce small, deliberately crafted perturbations that mislead neural networks, and their transferability from white-box to black-box target models remains a critical research focus. Input transformation-based attacks are a subfield of adversarial attacks that enhance input diversity through input transformations to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, existing input transformation-based attacks tend to exhibit limited cross-model transferability. Previous studies have shown that high transferability is associated with diverse attention heatmaps and the preservation of global semantics in transformed inputs. Motivated by this observation, we propose Block Stretch and Shrink (BSS), a method that divides an image into blocks and applies stretch and shrink operations to these blocks, thereby diversifying attention heatmaps in transformed inputs while maintaining their global semantics. Empirical evaluations on a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that BSS outperforms existing input transformation-based attack methods in terms of transferability. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the number scale, defined as the number of transformed inputs, in input transformation-based attacks, and advocate evaluating these methods under a unified number scale to enable fair and comparable assessments.",human
"Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.",human
"Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations.",human
"This paper presents a novel framework combining group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) with equivariant-aware structured pruning to produce compact, transformation-invariant models for resource-constrained environments. Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.   Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.   We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness. Our pipeline provides a reproducible framework for optimizing equivariant models, bridging the gap between group-theoretic network design and practical deployment constraints, with particular relevance to satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.",human
"Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.",human
"We study the problem of learning an unknown graph via group queries on node subsets, where each query reports whether at least one edge is present among the queried nodes. In general, learning arbitrary graphs with $n$ nodes and $k$ edges is hard in the non-adaptive setting, requiring $Ω\big(\min\{k^2\log n,\,n^2\}\big)$ tests even when a small error probability is allowed. We focus on learning Erdős--Rényi (ER) graphs $G\sim\mathrm{ER}(n,q)$ in the non-adaptive setting, where the expected number of edges is $\bar{k}=q\binom{n}{2}$, and we aim to design an efficient testing--decoding scheme achieving asymptotically vanishing error probability. Prior work (Li--Fresacher--Scarlett, NeurIPS 2019) presents a testing--decoding scheme that attains an order-optimal number of tests $O(\bar{k}\log n)$ but incurs $Ω(n^2)$ decoding time, whereas their proposed sublinear-time algorithm incurs an extra $(\log \bar{k})(\log n)$ factor in the number of tests. We extend the binary splitting approach, recently developed for non-adaptive group testing, to the ER graph learning setting, and prove that the edge set can be recovered with high probability using $O(\bar{k}\log n)$ tests while attaining decoding time $O(\bar{k}^{1+δ}\log n)$ for any fixed $δ>0$.",human
"The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning. The dataset and the code are available at: https://github.com/anshulsc/MirageTVQA.",human
"Deep Model Predictive Control (Deep MPC) is an evolving field that integrates model predictive control and deep learning. This manuscript is focused on a particular approach, which employs deep neural network in the loop with MPC. This class of approaches distributes control authority between a neural network and an MPC controller, in such a way that the neural network learns the model uncertainties while the MPC handles constraints. The approach is appealing because training data collected while the system is in operation can be used to fine-tune the neural network, and MPC prevents unsafe behavior during those learning transients. This manuscript explains implementation challenges of Deep MPC, algorithmic way to distribute control authority and argues that a poor choice in distributing control authority may lead to poor performance. A reason of poor performance is explained through a numerical experiment on a four-wheeled skid-steer dynamics.",human
"Transition states (TSs) are crucial for understanding reaction mechanisms, yet their exploration is limited by the complexity of experimental and computational approaches. Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\% in structural accuracy. These predicted TSs provide high-quality initial structures, accelerating the convergence of CI-NEB optimization. Additionally, TS-DFM can identify alternative reaction paths. In our experiments, even a more favorable TS with lower energy barrier is discovered. Further tests on RGD1 dataset confirm its strong generalization ability on unseen molecules and reaction types, highlighting its potential for facilitating reaction exploration.",human
"Artificial intelligence in dynamic, real-world environments requires the capacity for continual learning. However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold. Our results suggest that the utility of quantum computing in machine learning extends beyond potential speedups, offering a robust pathway for building adaptive artificial intelligence and lifelong learners.",human
"The brain's Path Integration (PI) mechanism offers substantial guidance and inspiration for Brain-Inspired Navigation (BIN). However, the PI capability constructed by the Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANNs) in most existing BIN studies exhibits significant computational redundancy, and its operational efficiency needs to be improved; otherwise, it will not be conducive to the practicality of BIN technology. To address this, this paper proposes an efficient PI approach using representation learning models to replicate CANN neurodynamic patterns. This method successfully replicates the neurodynamic patterns of CANN-modeled Head Direction Cells (HDCs) and Grid Cells (GCs) using lightweight Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These ANN-reconstructed HDC and GC models are then integrated to achieve brain-inspired PI for Dead Reckoning (DR). Benchmark tests in various environments, compared with the well-known NeuroSLAM system, demonstrate that this work not only accurately replicates the neurodynamic patterns of navigation cells but also matches NeuroSLAM in positioning accuracy. Moreover, efficiency improvements of approximately 17.5% on the general-purpose device and 40~50% on the edge device were observed, compared with NeuroSLAM.

"In daily life, people often move through spaces to find objects that meet their needs, posing a key challenge in embodied AI. Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.",human
"This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low ""follow rates"" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of ""resistance to overfitting pressure"" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.",human
"The paper introduces DelTriC (Delaunay Triangulation Clustering), a clustering algorithm which integrates PCA/UMAP-based projection, Delaunay triangulation, and a novel back-projection mechanism to form clusters in the original high-dimensional space. DelTriC decouples neighborhood construction from decision-making by first triangulating in a low-dimensional proxy to index local adjacency, and then back-projecting to the original space to perform robust edge pruning, merging, and anomaly detection. DelTriC can outperform traditional methods such as k-means, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN in many scenarios; it is both scalable and accurate, and it also significantly improves outlier detection.",human
"LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.",human
"With the increasing size of large language models, layer pruning has gained increased attention as a hardware-friendly approach for model compression. However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).",human
"Surface Electromyography (sEMG) provides vital insights into muscle function, but it can be noisy and challenging to acquire. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) provide a robust and wearable alternative to motion capture systems. This paper investigates the synthesis of normalized sEMG signals from 6-axis IMU data using a deep learning approach. We collected simultaneous sEMG and IMU data sampled at 1~KHz for various arm movements. A Sliding-Window-Wave-Net model, based on dilated causal convolutions, was trained to map the IMU data to the sEMG signal. The results show that the model successfully predicts the timing and general shape of muscle activations. Although peak amplitudes were often underestimated, the high temporal fidelity demonstrates the feasibility of using this method for muscle intent detection in applications such as prosthetics and rehabilitation biofeedback.",human
"LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.",human
"For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.",human
"News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.",human
"Recent text-to-image (T2I) models generate semantically coherent images from textual prompts, yet evaluating how well they align with individual user preferences remains an open challenge. Conventional evaluation methods, general reward functions or similarity-based metrics, fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes. In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent. We further introduce PIGBench, a per-user preference benchmark capturing diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIGReward surpasses existing methods in both accuracy and interpretability, establishing a scalable and reasoning-based foundation for personalized T2I evaluation and optimization. Taken together, our findings highlight PIGReward as a robust steptoward individually aligned T2I generation.",human
"Self-supervised representations excel at many vision and speech tasks, but their potential for audio-visual deepfake detection remains underexplored. Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.",human
"Accurate prediction of extreme weather events remains a major challenge for artificial intelligence based weather prediction systems. While deterministic models such as FuXi, GraphCast, and SFNO have achieved competitive forecast skill relative to numerical weather prediction, their ability to represent uncertainty and capture extremes is still limited. This study investigates how state of the art deterministic artificial intelligence based models respond to initial-condition perturbations and evaluates the resulting ensembles in forecasting extremes. Using three perturbation strategies (Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors, and Huge Ensembles), we generate 50 member ensembles for two major events in August 2022: the Pakistan floods and the China heatwave. Ensemble skill is assessed against ERA5 and compared with IFS ENS and the probabilistic AIFSENS model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. Results show that flow dependent perturbations produce the most realistic ensemble spread and highest probabilistic skill, narrowing but not closing the performance gap with numerical weather prediction ensembles. Across variables, artificial intelligence based weather models capture temperature extremes more effectively than precipitation. These findings demonstrate that input perturbations can extend deterministic models toward probabilistic forecasting, paving the way for approaches that combine flow dependent perturbations with generative or latent-space uncertainty modeling for reliable artificial intelligence-driven early warning systems.",human
"Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as ""I don't know"", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.",human
"Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.",human
"The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.",human

"Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct errors in machine-translated text, enhancing translation quality, while reducing the need for human intervention. Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems. We believe that this new resource will facilitate the future development and evaluation of APE systems.",human
"Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.",human
"Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.",human
"Device-guided music transfer adapts playback across unseen devices for users who lack them. Existing methods mainly focus on modifying the timbre, rhythm, harmony, or instrumentation to mimic genres or artists, overlooking the diverse hardware properties of the playback device (i.e., speaker). Therefore, we propose DeMT, which processes a speaker's frequency response curve as a line graph using a vision-language model to extract device embeddings. These embeddings then condition a hybrid transformer via feature-wise linear modulation. Fine-tuned on a self-collected dataset, DeMT enables effective speaker-style transfer and robust few-shot adaptation for unseen devices, supporting applications like device-style augmentation and quality enhancement.",human
"Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) crucial for understanding land-atmosphere energy exchange and monitoring climate change, especially in the rapidly warming Arctic. Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.",human
"While current Computer Use Agent (CUA) benchmarks measure task completion effectively, they provide limited assessment of enterprise deployment readiness, emphasizing functional correctness over the operational reliability required for production systems. We present UI-CUBE (UiPath Computer Use BEnchmark), a systematic benchmark comprising 226 tasks across two difficulty tiers designed to expose fundamental architectural limitations in current CUAs. Our evaluation covers simple UI interactions (136 tasks) and complex workflows including copy-paste tasks (50 tasks) and enterprise application scenarios (40 tasks), with systematic interface variation coverage, multi-resolution testing and automated validation of task success through the application state. Evaluation of five state-of-the-art models reveals a sharp capability cliff rather than gradual performance degradation. Simple UI interactions achieve 67-85% success rates (compared to 97.9% human performance), but complex workflows drop precipitously to 9-19%. Human evaluators with no prior application experience achieve only 61.2% on complex tasks despite near-perfect performance on simple tasks, establishing realistic performance ceilings. This discontinuous performance pattern -- where agents achieve 68-87% of human performance on simple tasks but only 15-32% on complex workflows -- indicates fundamental architectural limitations in memory management, hierarchical planning, and state coordination rather than incremental capability gaps addressable through better training or prompting. UI-CUBE functions as an enterprise-readiness diagnostic, revealing that while current CUAs can manipulate individual interface elements, they cannot yet function as reliable workflow automation tools. These findings provide architectural insights essential for developing production-ready CUAs capable of managing complex, multi-step enterprise processes.",human
"Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.",human
"We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.",human
"Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens2.",human
"Systolic array accelerators execute CNNs with energy dominated by the switching activity of multiply accumulate (MAC) units. Although prior work exploits weight dependent MAC power for compression, existing methods often use global activation models, coarse energy proxies, or layer-agnostic policies, which limits their effectiveness on real hardware. We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint. Experiments on different CNN models demonstrate up to 58.6\% energy reduction with 2-3\% accuracy drop, outperforming a state-of-the-art power-aware baseline.",human
"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential tools for detecting network attacks and intrusions. While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.",human
"Parameterised quantum circuit (PQC) based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm at the intersection of quantum computing and reinforcement learning (RL). By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.",human
"Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (""retain-invariant""). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics.",human
"As the Middle East emerges as a strategic hub for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, the feasibility of deploying sustainable datacenters in desert environments has become a topic of growing relevance. This paper presents an empirical study analyzing the energy consumption and carbon footprint of large language model (LLM) inference across four countries: the United Arab Emirates, Iceland, Germany, and the United States of America using DeepSeek Coder 1.3B and the HumanEval dataset on the task of code generation. We use the CodeCarbon library to track energy and carbon emissions andcompare geographical trade-offs for climate-aware AI deployment. Our findings highlight both the challenges and potential of datacenters in desert regions and provide a balanced outlook on their role in global AI expansion.",human
"The resource demands of deep neural network (DNN) models introduce significant performance challenges, especially when deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing solutions like model compression often sacrifice accuracy, while specialized hardware remains costly and inflexible. Hybrid inference methods, however, typically overlook how operator characteristics impact performance. In this work, we present SparOA, a CPU-GPU hybrid inference framework, which leverages both sparsity and computational intensity to optimize operator scheduling. SparOA embraces aforementioned challenges through three key components: (1) a threshold predictor that accurately determines optimal sparsity and computational intensity thresholds; (2) a reinforcement learning-based scheduler that dynamically optimizes resource allocation based on real-time hardware states; and (3) a hybrid inference engine that enhances efficiency through asynchronous execution and batch size optimization.Extensive results show that SparOA achieves an average speedup of 1.22-1.31x compared to all baselines, and outperforms the CPU-Only by up to 50.7x. Also, SparOA achieves optimal energy-per-inference, consuming 7\%-16\% less energy than the SOTA co-execution baseline.",human
"We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.",human
"The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool-using agents causes their alignment training to manifest in new ways. Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.",human
"Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.",human
"Discrete fuzzy numbers, and in particular those defined over a finite chain $L_n = \{0, \ldots, n\}$, have been effectively employed to represent linguistic information within the framework of fuzzy systems. Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \{ 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \cdots < y_{m-1} < y_m = 1 \}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \in \mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values. The results demonstrate that this formulation substantially reduces computational cost and enables the efficient implementation of algebraic operations -- such as aggregation and implication -- on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers.",human
"This study investigates how cultural proximity affects the ability to detect AI-generated fake news by comparing South African participants with those from other nationalities. As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content. These insights contribute to understanding cross-cultural dimensions of misinformation detection and inform strategies for combating AI-generated fake news in increasingly globalised information ecosystems where content crosses cultural and geographical boundaries.",human
"Molecular fingerprinting methods use hash functions to create fixed-length vector representations of molecules. However, hash collisions cause distinct substructures to be represented with the same feature, leading to overestimates in molecular similarity calculations. We investigate whether using exact fingerprints improves accuracy compared to standard compressed fingerprints in molecular property prediction and Bayesian optimization where the underlying predictive model is a Gaussian process. We find that using exact fingerprints yields a small yet consistent improvement in predictive accuracy on five molecular property prediction benchmarks from the DOCKSTRING dataset. However, these gains did not translate to significant improvements in Bayesian optimization performance.",human
"AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.",human
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.",human
"Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.",human
"LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.",human
"We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

"Chest radiography remains one of the most widely used imaging modalities for thoracic diagnosis, yet increasing imaging volumes and radiologist workload continue to challenge timely interpretation. In this work, we investigate the use of MedImageInsight, a medical imaging foundational model, for automated binary classification of chest X-rays into Normal and Abnormal categories. Two approaches were evaluated: (1) fine-tuning MedImageInsight for end-to-end classification, and (2) employing the model as a feature extractor for a transfer learning pipeline using traditional machine learning classifiers. Experiments were conducted using a combination of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and real-world clinical data sourced from partner hospitals. The fine-tuned classifier achieved the highest performance, with an ROC-AUC of 0.888 and superior calibration compared to the transfer learning models, demonstrating performance comparable to established architectures such as CheXNet. These results highlight the effectiveness of foundational medical imaging models in reducing task-specific training requirements while maintaining diagnostic reliability. The system is designed for integration into web-based and hospital PACS workflows to support triage and reduce radiologist burden. Future work will extend the model to multi-label pathology classification to provide preliminary diagnostic interpretation in clinical environments.",human
"The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.",human
"Training data collected in the wild often contain noisy labels and outliers that substantially degrade the performance and reliability of deep neural networks. While data cleaning is commonly applied as a separate preprocessing stage, such two-stage pipelines neither fully exploit feedback from the downstream model nor adapt to unknown noise patterns. We propose Step-E, a simple framework that integrates sample selection and model learning into a single optimization process. At each epoch, Step-E ranks samples by loss and gradually increases the fraction of high-loss examples that are excluded from gradient updates after a brief warm-up stage, yielding an online curriculum that focuses on easy and consistent examples and eventually ignores persistent outliers. On CIFAR-100N, Step-E improves the test accuracy of a ResNet-18 model from 43.3% (+/- 0.7%) to 50.4% (+/- 0.9%), clearly outperforming loss truncation, self-paced learning, and one-shot filtering while approaching the clean-label oracle at 60.5% (+/- 0.2%). On CIFAR-10N (aggre), Step-E also improves over the noisy baseline (85.3% vs. 83.9%) and nearly matches the clean-label oracle (85.9%), with only moderate training-time overhead.",human
"From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.",human
"Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multi-modal reasoning and understanding. Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.",human

"The rapidly growing computational demands of diffusion models for image generation have raised significant concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.",human
"In recent times, discussions on social media platforms have increasingly come under scrutiny due to the proliferation of science denial and fake news. Traditional solutions, such as regulatory actions, have been implemented to mitigate the spread of misinformation; however, these measures alone are not sufficient. To complement these efforts, educational approaches are becoming essential in empowering users to critically engage with misinformation. Conversation training, through serious games or personalized methods, has emerged as a promising strategy to help users handle science denial and toxic conversation tactics. This paper suggests an interdisciplinary seminar to explore the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a persona of a science denier to support people in identifying misinformation and improving resilience against toxic interactions. In the seminar, groups of four to five students will develop an AI-based chatbot that enables realistic interactions with science-denial argumentation structures. The task involves planning the setting, integrating a Large Language Model to facilitate natural dialogues, implementing the chatbot using the RASA framework, and evaluating the outcomes in a user study. It is crucial that users understand what they need to do during the interaction, how to conclude it, and how the relevant information is conveyed. The seminar does not aim to develop chatbots for practicing debunking but serves to teach AI technologies and test the feasibility of this idea for future applications. The chatbot seminar is conducted as a hybrid, parallel master's module at the participating educational institutions.",human
"Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",human
"Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.",human
"Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering discovers intrinsic grouping patterns of temporal data samples. Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.",human
"Machine learning (ML) has greatly advanced data-driven channel modeling and resource optimization in wireless communication systems. However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.",human
"Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only ""thinking"" in tokens but also ""acting"" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack ""budget awareness"" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to ""dig deeper"" on a promising lead or ""pivot"" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.",human
"We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework discovers identity-editing directions through optimization guided by novel reagent losses, which supervise for attribute preservation and identity suppression. We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.",human
"Fine-tuning BERT for text classification can be computationally challenging and requires careful hyper-parameter tuning. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of quantum algorithms to outperform conventional methods in machine learning and text classification tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates an n-qubit quantum circuit with a classical BERT model for text classification. We evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned classical-quantum BERT and demonstrate its feasibility as well as its potential in advancing this research area. Our experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model achieves performance that is competitive with, and in some cases better than, the classical baselines on standard benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates the adaptability of classical-quantum models for fine-tuning pre-trained models across diverse datasets. Overall, the hybrid model highlights the promise of quantum computing in achieving improved performance for text classification tasks.",human
"The rapid progress in Generative AI and Agent technologies is profoundly transforming enterprise data management and analytics.

Through representative use cases, key challenges related to distributed deployment, data security, and inherent difficulties in SQL generation tasks are discussed.",human
"Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.",human
"The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.",human
"Trajectory forecasting for autonomous driving must deliver accurate, calibrated multi-modal futures under tight compute and latency constraints. We propose a compact hybrid quantum architecture that aligns quantum inductive bias with road-scene structure by operating in an ego-centric, lane-aligned frame and predicting residual corrections to a kinematic baseline instead of absolute poses. The model combines a transformer-inspired quantum attention encoder (9 qubits), a parameter-lean quantum feedforward stack (64 layers, ${\sim}1200$ trainable angles), and a Fourier-based decoder that uses shallow entanglement and phase superposition to generate 16 trajectory hypotheses in a single pass, with mode confidences derived from the latent spectrum. All circuit parameters are trained with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), avoiding backpropagation through non-analytic components. In the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the model achieves minADE (minimum Average Displacement Error) of \SI{1.94}{m} and minFDE (minimum Final Displacement Error) of \SI{3.56}{m} in the $16$ models predicted over the horizon of \SI{2.0}{s}, consistently outperforming a kinematic baseline with reduced miss rates and strong recall. Ablations confirm that residual learning in the lane frame, truncated Fourier decoding, shallow entanglement, and spectrum-based ranking focus capacity where it matters, yielding stable optimization and reliable multi-modal forecasts from small, shallow quantum circuits on a modern autonomous-driving benchmark.",human
"Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values often involves balancing multiple, conflicting objectives such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.",human
"Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.",human
"Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing over $220 billion in annual economic losses and jeopardizing food security. The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.",human
"Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns"" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.",human
"Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for training infinitely deep weight-tied neural networks that achieve state of the art performance across many modern machine learning tasks. Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments.",human
"Optimizing patent claims is a critical yet challenging task, demanding careful balance between maximizing novelty and preserving legal scope. Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\%, and up to 9\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.",human
"Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)",human
"Maximizing performance on available GPU hardware is an ongoing challenge for modern AI inference systems. Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.",human
"Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.   We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.",human
"Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.",human
"As the development of AI-generated contents (AIGC), multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) struggle to identify generated visual inputs from real ones. Such shortcoming causes vulnerability against visual deceptions, where the models are deceived by generated contents, and the reliability of reasoning processes is jeopardized. Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully reasoning-based framework against AIGC visual deceptions. Our approach achieved a large margin of performance improvement over the strongest existing LLM baselines and SOTA performance on AEGIS benchmark.",human
"Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.",human
"Language agents are rapidly expanding from single-user assistants to multi-user collaborators in shared workspaces and groups. However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments. Finally, we introduce a first-step defense with task-based clustering to mitigate this new class of vulnerability",human
"Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance. The code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/Yuzt-zju/RASTP.",human
"Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.",human
"12-lead ECGs with high sampling frequency are the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia detection, but their short-term, spot-check nature often misses intermittent events. Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life. This enables smaller wearables, promoting long-term monitoring of cardiac health.",human
"With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents have demonstrated increasing proficiency in scientific tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experimental design to manuscript writing. Such agent systems are commonly referred to as ""AI Scientists."" However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.",human

"Detecting trajectory anomalies is a vital task in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling the identification of unsafe, inefficient, or irregular travel behaviours. While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.",human
"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptomic profiling at cellular resolution but suffers from pervasive dropout events that obscure biological signals. We present SCR-MF, a modular two-stage workflow that combines principled dropout detection using scRecover with robust non-parametric imputation via missForest. Across public and simulated datasets, SCR-MF achieves robust and interpretable performance comparable to or exceeding existing imputation methods in most cases, while preserving biological fidelity and transparency. Runtime analysis demonstrates that SCR-MF provides a competitive balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for mid-scale single-cell datasets.",human
"In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.",human
"Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging modality that combines biologics-like affinity with small-molecule-like developability, but their vast combinatorial space and multi-parameter objectives make lead optimization slow and challenging. Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints. Overall, PepEVOLVE offers a practical, reproducible path to peptide lead optimization when optimal edit sites are unknown, enabling more efficient exploration and improving design quality across multiple objectives.",human
"Early detection of rising talents is of paramount importance in the field of advertising. In this paper, we define a concept of talent breakout and propose a method to detect Japanese talents before their rise to stardom. The main focus of the study is to determine the effectiveness of combining Twitter and TV data on predicting time-dependent changes in social data. Although traditional time-series models are known to be robust in many applications, the success of neural network models in various fields (e.g.\ Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning) continues to spark an interest in the time-series community to apply new techniques in practice. Therefore, in order to find the best modeling approach, we have experimented with traditional, neural network and ensemble learning methods. We observe that ensemble learning methods outperform traditional and neural network models based on standard regression metrics. However, by utilizing the concept of talent breakout, we are able to assess the true forecasting ability of the models, where neural networks outperform traditional and ensemble learning methods in terms of precision and recall.",human
"Arguably, specialized attention heads dubbed induction heads (IHs) underlie the remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of modern language models (LMs); yet, a precise characterization of their formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the relationship between statistical properties of training data (for both natural and synthetic data) and IH formation. We show that (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts the point at which IHs form; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect the formation of IHs, and we find a precise Pareto frontier in terms of these two values; and (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency and reliability is sufficient for IH formation, but when the frequency and reliability are low, categoriality and the shape of the marginal distribution matter.",human
"Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.",human
"Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.",human
"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.",human
"The recent boom and rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a wide range of applications warrants a deeper understanding of their security and safety vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks for two leading publicly available LLMs, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and OpenAI's GPT-4 (specifically the GPT-4o mini model accessible in the free tier). The research utilized two main bypass strategies: 'self-bypass', where models were prompted to circumvent their own safety protocols, and 'cross-bypass', where one model generated adversarial prompts to exploit vulnerabilities in the other. Four attack methods were employed - direct injection, role-playing, context manipulation, and obfuscation - to generate five distinct categories of unsafe content: hate speech, illegal activities, malicious code, dangerous content, and misinformation. The success of the attack was determined by the generation of disallowed content, with successful jailbreaks assigned a severity score. The findings indicate a disparity in jailbreak susceptibility between 2.5 Flash and GPT-4, suggesting variations in their safety implementations or architectural design. Cross-bypass attacks were particularly effective, indicating that an ample amount of vulnerabilities exist in the underlying transformer architecture. This research contributes a scalable framework for automated AI red-teaming and provides data-driven insights into the current state of LLM safety, underscoring the complex challenge of balancing model capabilities with robust safety mechanisms.",human
"The growing number of Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities and response styles provides users with a wider range of choices, which presents challenges in selecting appropriate LLMs, as user preferences vary in terms of performance, cost, and response style. Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency. Moreover, PersonalizedRouter demonstrates strong few-shot generalization, achieving 64.81% and 85.80% of the fully trained model's performance when adapting to new users and new LLMs.",human
"Graph Neural Networks rely on local message passing, which limits their ability to model long-range dependencies in graphs. Existing approaches extend this range through continuous-time dynamics or dense self-attention, but both suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability. We propose Topologic Attention Networks, a new framework that applies topologic attention, a probabilistic mechanism that learns how information should flow through both direct and indirect connections in a graph. Unlike conventional attention that depends on explicit pairwise interactions, topologic attention emerges from the learned information propagation of the graph, enabling unified reasoning over local and global relationships. This method achieves provides state-of-the-art performance across all measured baseline models.

"Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.",human
"Global routing is a critical stage in electronic design automation (EDA) that enables early estimation and optimization of the routability of modern integrated circuits with respect to congestion, power dissipation, and design complexity. Batching is a primary concern in top-performing global routers, grouping nets into manageable sets to enable parallel processing and efficient resource usage. This process improves memory usage, scalable parallelization on modern hardware, and routing congestion by controlling net interactions within each batch. However, conventional batching methods typically depend on heuristics that are computationally expensive and can lead to suboptimal results (oversized batches with conflicting nets, excessive batch counts degrading parallelization, and longer batch generation times), ultimately limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, a novel batching algorithm enhanced with Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs) is introduced in this paper, enabling more effective parallelization by generating fewer higher-quality batches in less time. The proposed algorithm is tested on the latest ISPD'24 contest benchmarks, demonstrating up to 40% runtime reduction with only 0.002% degradation in routing quality as compared to state-of-the-art router.",human
"Modern cities produce vast streams of heterogeneous data, from infrastructure maps to mobility logs and satellite imagery. However, integrating these sources into coherent spatial models for planning and prediction remains a major challenge. Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response. The code and datasets can be downloaded from here.",human
"Automated program repair has been shown to be susceptible to generating repaired code that passes on seen tests but fails on a hold-out set of hidden tests. This problem, dubbed test overfitting, has been identified and studied before the rise of large language models. We experimentally study how much test overfitting is still a problem today, using repository-level SWE-bench tasks.",human
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that, in addition to directly impairing functional mobility, is frequently associated with vocal impairments such as hypophonia and dysarthria, which typically manifest in the early stages. The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\%$ and $92.11\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies. Overall, this study confirms the efficiency of DNNs and emphasizes their potential to provide greater accuracy and reliability for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using voice-based biomarkers.",human
"High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: https://github.com/mkhateri/Awesome-MRI-Super-Resolution.

"This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.",human
"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly powerful models of brain computation, yet it remains unclear whether improving their task performance also makes their internal representations more similar to brain signals. To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.",human
"Monitoring aquatic species, especially elusive ones like lobsters, presents challenges. This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).   The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.   For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds. This research offers a promising non-invasive PAM approach for lobster conservation, detection, and management in aquaculture and fisheries, enabling real-world edge computing applications for underwater species.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.",human
"Ordinal classification has been widely applied in many high-stakes applications, e.g., medical imaging and diagnosis, where reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for decision making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).",human
"Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.",human
"Advances in technology are transforming sustainable cattle farming practices, with electronic feeding systems generating big longitudinal datasets on individual animal feed intake, offering the possibility for autonomous precision livestock systems. However, the literature still lacks a methodology that fully leverages these longitudinal big data to accurately predict feed intake accounting for environmental conditions. To fill this gap, we developed an AI-based framework to accurately predict feed intake of individual animals and pen-level aggregation. Data from 19 experiments (>16.5M samples; 2013-2024) conducted at Nancy M. Cummings Research Extension & Education Center (Carmen, ID) feedlot facility and environmental data from AgriMet Network weather stations were used to develop two novel environmental indices: InComfort-Index, based solely on meteorological variables, showed good predictive capability for thermal comfort but had limited ability to predict feed intake; EASI-Index, a hybrid index integrating environmental variables with feed intake behavior, performed well in predicting feed intake but was less effective for thermal comfort. Together with the environmental indices, machine learning models were trained and the best-performing machine learning model (XGBoost) accuracy was RMSE of 1.38 kg/day for animal-level and only 0.14 kg/(day-animal) at pen-level. This approach provides a robust AI-based framework for predicting feed intake in individual animals and pens, with potential applications in precision management of feedlot cattle, through feed waste reduction, resource optimization, and climate-adaptive livestock management.",human
"Transformers have defined the state-of-the-art for clinical prediction tasks involving electronic health records (EHRs). The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data. This paper presents a first ablation study with systematic design choices for input tokenization, model configuration and temporal data preprocessing. Future model development in clinical prediction tasks using EHRs could build upon this study's recommendation as a starting point.",human
"Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.",human
"In this work, we study English-language vaccine discourse in social media posts, specifically posts on X (formerly Twitter), in seven years before the COVID-19 outbreak (2013 to 2019) and three years after the outbreak was first reported (2020 to 2022). Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.",human
"Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.",human
"Existing EEG foundation models mainly treat neural signals as generic time series in Euclidean space, ignoring the intrinsic geometric structure of neural dynamics that constrains brain activity to low-dimensional manifolds. This fundamental mismatch between model assumptions and neural geometry limits representation quality and cross-subject generalization. ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations. The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization. The geometric approach reveals meaningful neural patterns consistent with neurophysiological principles, establishing geometric constraints as essential for effective EEG foundation models.",human
"This study enhances breast cancer prediction by using large language models to infer the likelihood of confounding diseases, namely diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, from routine clinical data.

The approach shows promise for noninvasive prescreening and clinical integration, supporting improved early detection and shared decision-making in breast cancer diagnosis.",human
"We introduce WorldGen, a system that enables the automatic creation of large-scale, interactive 3D worlds directly from text prompts. Our approach transforms natural language descriptions into traversable, fully textured environments that can be immediately explored or edited within standard game engines. By combining LLM-driven scene layout reasoning, procedural generation, diffusion-based 3D generation, and object-aware scene decomposition, WorldGen bridges the gap between creative intent and functional virtual spaces, allowing creators to design coherent, navigable worlds without manual modeling or specialized 3D expertise. The system is fully modular and supports fine-grained control over layout, scale, and style, producing worlds that are geometrically consistent, visually rich, and efficient to render in real time. This work represents a step towards accessible, generative world-building at scale, advancing the frontier of 3D generative AI for applications in gaming, simulation, and immersive social environments.",human
"Intransitive verbs fall into two different syntactic classes, unergatives and unaccusatives. It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax. However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.",human
"Evaluating and measuring AI Safety Level (ASL) threats are crucial for guiding stakeholders to implement safeguards that keep risks within acceptable limits. ASL-3+ models present a unique risk in their ability to uplift novice non-state actors, especially in the realm of biosecurity. Existing evaluation metrics, such as LAB-Bench, BioLP-bench, and WMDP, can reliably assess model uplift and domain knowledge. However, metrics that better contextualize ""real-world risks"" are needed to inform the safety case for LLMs, along with scalable, open-ended metrics to keep pace with their rapid advancements. To address both gaps, we introduce MOCET, an interpretable and doubly-scalable metric (automatable and open-ended) that can quantify real-world risks.",human
"In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.",human
"We introduce the Bayesian Information-Theoretic Sampling for hierarchical GAussian Process Surrogates (BITS for GAPS) framework to emulate latent components in hybrid physical systems. BITS for GAPS supports serial hybrid modeling, where known physics governs part of the system and residual dynamics are represented as a latent function inferred from data. A Gaussian process prior is placed over the latent function, with hierarchical priors on its hyperparameters to encode physically meaningful structure in the predictive posterior.   To guide data acquisition, we derive entropy-based acquisition functions that quantify expected information gain from candidate input locations, identifying samples most informative for training the surrogate. Specifically, we obtain a closed-form expression for the differential entropy of the predictive posterior and establish a tractable lower bound for efficient evaluation. These derivations approximate the predictive posterior as a finite, uniformly weighted mixture of Gaussian processes.   We demonstrate the framework's utility by modeling activity coefficients in vapor-liquid equilibrium systems, embedding the surrogate into extended Raoult's law for distillation design. Numerical results show that entropy-guided sampling improves sample efficiency by targeting regions of high uncertainty and potential information gain. This accelerates surrogate convergence, enhances predictive accuracy in non-ideal regimes, and preserves physical consistency. Overall, BITS for GAPS provides an efficient, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware framework for hybrid modeling of complex physical systems.",human
"While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.",human
"Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator's mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain-body-environment interactions. This non-representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts.",human
"3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.",human
"Minimizing loss functions is central to machine-learning training. Although first-order methods dominate practical applications, higher-order techniques such as Newton's method can deliver greater accuracy and faster convergence, yet are often avoided due to their computational cost. This work analyzes the impact of finite-precision arithmetic on Newton steps and establishes a convergence theorem for mixed-precision Newton optimizers, including ""quasi"" and ""inexact"" variants. The theorem provides not only convergence guarantees but also a priori estimates of the achievable solution accuracy. Empirical evaluations on standard regression benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform Adam on the Australian and MUSH datasets. The second part of the manuscript introduces GN_k, a generalized Gauss-Newton method that enables partial computation of second-order derivatives. GN_k attains performance comparable to full Newton's method on regression tasks while requiring significantly fewer derivative evaluations.",human
"Penalty-based methods have become popular for solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems, thanks to their effective first-order nature. However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the ""flatness"" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.",human
"Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) tasks impose a strict logical constraint: a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one instance within it is positive. While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.",human
"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against machine learning (ML) models aim to determine whether a given data point was part of the model training data. These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize). Our findings reveal that these samples are often outliers within their classes (e.g., noisy or hard to classify). We then propose potential defensive strategies to protect these vulnerable samples and enhance the privacy-preserving capabilities of ML models.

"This paper presents JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Code Generation from Bangla Instructions. We propose a multi-agent-based pipeline. First, a code-generation agent produces an initial solution from the input instruction. The candidate program is then executed against the provided unit tests (pytest-style, assert-based). Only the failing cases are forwarded to a debugger agent, which reruns the tests, extracts error traces, and, conditioning on the error messages, the current program, and the relevant test cases, generates a revised solution. Using this approach, our submission achieved first place in the shared task with a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. We also make our code public.",human
"Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.",human
"This paper introduces Generative Augmented Reality (GAR) as a next-generation paradigm that reframes augmentation as a process of world re-synthesis rather than world composition by a conventional AR engine. GAR replaces the conventional AR engine's multi-stage modules with a unified generative backbone, where environmental sensing, virtual content, and interaction signals are jointly encoded as conditioning inputs for continuous video generation. We formalize the computational correspondence between AR and GAR, survey the technical foundations that make real-time generative augmentation feasible, and outline prospective applications that leverage its unified inference model. We envision GAR as a future AR paradigm that delivers high-fidelity experiences in terms of realism, interactivity, and immersion, while eliciting new research challenges on technologies, content ecosystems, and the ethical and societal implications.",human
"Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.",human
"As digital communication grows in importance when connecting with healthcare providers, traditional behavioral and content message features are imbued with renewed significance. If one is to meaningfully connect with them, it is crucial to understand what drives them to engage and respond. In this study, the authors analyzed several million text messages sent through the Impiricus platform to learn which factors influenced whether or not a doctor clicked on a link in a message. Several key insights came to light through the use of logistic regression, random forest, and neural network models, the details of which the authors discuss in this paper.",human
"Graphs provide a unified representation of semantic content and relational structure, making them a natural fit for domains such as molecular modeling, citation networks, and social graphs. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.",human
"Audio-language pretraining holds promise for general-purpose audio understanding, yet remains underexplored compared to its vision counterpart. While vision-language models like CLIP serve as widely adopted foundations, existing audio-language models primarily excel at retrieval tasks with limited adoption as general-purpose encoders. We identify three key barriers: limited large-scale audio-text corpora, insufficient caption diversity, and lack of systematic exploration and evaluation. To this end, we introduce CaptionStew, a 10.7M caption dataset aggregating diverse open-source audio-text corpora across multiple domains and captioning styles. Using this resource, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing contrastive and captioning objectives for audio representation learning across speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Our results demonstrate that audio-language pretraining yields competitive, transferable representations. Through systematic data-scaling experiments, we reveal complementary objective strengths: contrastive learning achieves superior data efficiency at smaller scales, while captioning demonstrates better scalability on language-involved audio understanding tasks. We also find that common supervised initialization practices provide diminishing returns at scale, challenging current approaches. These findings establish audio-language pretraining as a viable pathway toward general-purpose audio representations, guiding future research. To accelerate progress, we release data preparation recipes, training protocols, and pretrained models, paving the way toward universal audio understanding.",human
"Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.",human
We introduce fermionic neural network field theories via Grassmann-valued neural networks. Free theories are obtained by a generalization of the Central Limit Theorem to Grassmann variables. This enables the realization of the free Dirac spinor at infinite width and a four fermion interaction at finite width. Yukawa couplings are introduced by breaking the statistical independence of the output weights for the fermionic and bosonic fields. A large class of interacting supersymmetric quantum mechanics and field theory models are introduced by super-affine transformations on the input that realize a superspace formalism.,human
"The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.",human
"We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., ""yellow school bus""), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.",human
"Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.",human
"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.",human
"Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.",human
"Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks. Robot rollouts are best viewed on our website: https://aina-robot.github.io.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning & knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems. By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale.",human
"This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.",human
"Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity",human
"Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.",human
"Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.",human
"We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.",human
"Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.",human
"Recent advancements in neural audio codecs have not only enabled superior audio compression but also enhanced speech synthesis techniques. Researchers are now exploring their potential as universal acoustic feature extractors for a broader range of speech processing tasks. Building on this trend, we introduce Codec2Vec, the first speech representation learning framework that relies exclusively on discrete audio codec units. This approach offers several advantages, including improved data storage and transmission efficiency, faster training, and enhanced data privacy. We explore masked prediction with various training target derivation strategies to thoroughly understand the effectiveness of this framework. Evaluated on the SUPERB benchmark, Codec2Vec achieves competitive performance compared to continuous-input models while reducing storage requirements by up to 16.5x and training time by 2.3x, showcasing its scalability and efficiency.",human
"Symmetry breaking is a crucial technique in modern combinatorial solving, but it is difficult to be sure it is implemented correctly. The most successful approach to deal with bugs is to make solvers certifying, so that they output not just a solution, but also a mathematical proof of correctness in a standard format, which can then be checked by a formally verified checker. This requires justifying symmetry reasoning within the proof, but developing efficient methods for this has remained a long-standing open challenge. A fully general approach was recently proposed by Bogaerts et al. (2023), but it relies on encoding lexicographic orders with big integers, which quickly becomes infeasible for large symmetries. In this work, we develop a method for instead encoding orders with auxiliary variables. We show that this leads to orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in both theory and practice by running experiments on proof logging and checking for SAT symmetry breaking using the state-of-the-art satsuma symmetry breaker and the VeriPB proof checking toolchain.",human
"Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.",human
"Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.",human
"Although passwords remain the primary defense against unauthorized access, users often tend to use passwords that are easy to remember. This behavior significantly increases security risks, also due to the fact that traditional password strength evaluation methods are often inadequate. In this discussion paper, we present SODA ADVANCE, a data reconstruction tool also designed to enhance evaluation processes related to the password strength. In particular, SODA ADVANCE integrates a specialized module aimed at evaluating password strength by leveraging publicly available data from multiple sources, including social media platforms. Moreover, we investigate the capabilities and risks associated with emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) in evaluating and generating passwords, respectively. Experimental assessments conducted with 100 real users demonstrate that LLMs can generate strong and personalized passwords possibly defined according to user profiles. Additionally, LLMs were shown to be effective in evaluating passwords, especially when they can take into account user profile data.",human
"We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.",human
"We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D ""data barrier"". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.",human
"We develop a computational framework for classifying Galois groups of irreducible degree-7 polynomials over~$\mathbb{Q}$, combining explicit resolvent methods with machine learning techniques. A database of over one million normalized projective septics is constructed, each annotated with algebraic invariants~$J_0, \dots, J_4$ derived from binary transvections. For each polynomial, we compute resolvent factorizations to determine its Galois group among the seven transitive subgroups of~$S_7$ identified by Foulkes. Using this dataset, we train a neurosymbolic classifier that integrates invariant-theoretic features with supervised learning, yielding improved accuracy in detecting rare solvable groups compared to coefficient-based models. The resulting database provides a reproducible resource for constructive Galois theory and supports empirical investigations into group distribution under height constraints. The methodology extends to higher-degree cases and illustrates the utility of hybrid symbolic-numeric techniques in computational algebra.",human
"We study community detection in the \emph{symmetric $k$-stochastic block model}, where $n$ nodes are evenly partitioned into $k$ clusters with intra- and inter-cluster connection probabilities $p$ and $q$, respectively.   Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax-optimal misclassification rate   \begin{equation*}   \exp \Bigl(-\bigl(1 \pm o(1)\bigr) \tfrac{C}{k}\Bigr),   \quad \text{where } C = (\sqrt{pn} - \sqrt{qn})^2,   \end{equation*}   whenever $C \ge K\,k^2\,\log k$ for some universal constant $K$, matching the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold up to a $\log k$ factor.   Notably, this rate holds even when an adversary corrupts an $η\le \exp\bigl(- (1 \pm o(1)) \tfrac{C}{k}\bigr)$ fraction of the nodes.   To the best of our knowledge, the minimax rate was previously only attainable either via computationally inefficient procedures [ZZ15] or via polynomial-time algorithms that require strictly stronger assumptions such as $C \ge K k^3$ [GMZZ17].   In the node-robust setting, the best known algorithm requires the substantially stronger condition $C \ge K k^{102}$ [LM22].   Our results close this gap by providing the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the minimax rate near the KS threshold in both settings.   Our work has two key technical contributions:   (1) we robustify majority voting via the Sum-of-Squares framework,   (2) we develop a novel graph bisection algorithm via robust majority voting, which allows us to significantly improve the misclassification rate to $1/\mathrm{poly}(k)$ for the initial estimation near the KS threshold.",human
"Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.",human
"This brief note clarifies that, in Generator Matching (which subsumes a large family of flow matching and diffusion models over continuous, manifold, and discrete spaces), both the Bregman divergence loss and the linear parameterization of the generator can depend on both the current state $X_t$ and the time $t$, and we show that the expectation over time in the loss can be taken with respect to a broad class of time distributions. We also show this for Edit Flows, which falls outside of Generator Matching. That the loss can depend on $t$ clarifies that time-dependent loss weighting schemes, often used in practice to stabilize training, are theoretically justified when the specific flow or diffusion scheme is a special case of Generator Matching (or Edit Flows). It also often simplifies the construction of $X_1$-predictor schemes, which are sometimes preferred for model-related reasons. We show examples that rely upon the dependence of linear parameterizations, and of the Bregman divergence loss, on $t$ and $X_t$.",human
"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis -- where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones -- and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.",human
"The integration of sensing and communication functionalities within a common system is one of the main innovation drivers for next-generation networks. In this paper, we introduce a quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol that leverages entanglement in quantum carriers of information to enable both superdense coding and quantum sensing. The proposed approach adaptively optimizes encoding and quantum measurement via variational circuit learning, while employing classical machine learning-based decoders and estimators to process the measurement outcomes. Numerical results for qudit systems demonstrate that the proposed QISAC protocol can achieve a flexible trade-off between classical communication rate and accuracy of parameter estimation.",human
"Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.",human
"We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.",human
"Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.",human
"In this paper, we present gfnx, a fast and scalable package for training and evaluating Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) written in JAX. gfnx provides an extensive set of environments and metrics for benchmarking, accompanied with single-file implementations of core objectives for training GFlowNets. We include synthetic hypergrids, multiple sequence generation environments with various editing regimes and particular reward designs for molecular generation, phylogenetic tree construction, Bayesian structure learning, and sampling from the Ising model energy. Across different tasks, gfnx achieves significant wall-clock speedups compared to Pytorch-based benchmarks (such as torchgfn library) and author implementations.

"Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.",human
"Multi-agent coordination is critical for next-generation autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, yet naive implementations of communication-based rerouting can lead to catastrophic performance degradation. This study investigates a fundamental problem in decentralized multi-agent navigation: routing loops, where vehicles without persistent obstacle memory become trapped in cycles of inefficient path recalculation. Through systematic simulation experiments involving 72 unique configurations across varying vehicle densities (15, 35, 55 vehicles) and obstacle frequencies (6, 20 obstacles), we demonstrate that memory-less reactive rerouting increases average travel time by up to 682% compared to baseline conditions. To address this, we introduce Object Memory Management (OMM), a lightweight mechanism enabling agents to retain and share knowledge of previously encountered obstacles. OMM operates by maintaining a distributed blacklist of blocked nodes, which each agent consults during Dijkstra-based path recalculation, effectively preventing redundant routing attempts. Our results show that OMM-enabled coordination reduces average travel time by 75.7% and wait time by 88% compared to memory-less systems, while requiring only 1.67 route recalculations per vehicle versus 9.83 in memory-less scenarios. This work provides empirical evidence that persistent, shared memory is not merely beneficial but essential for robust multi-agent coordination in dynamic environments. The findings have implications beyond autonomous vehicles, informing the design of decentralized systems in robotics, network routing, and distributed AI. We provide a comprehensive experimental analysis, including detailed scenario breakdowns, scalability assessments, and visual documentation of the routing loop phenomenon, demonstrating OMM's critical role in preventing detrimental feedback cycles in cooperative multi-agent systems.",human
"Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design"". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification. The associated code can be found at https://github.com/julsoria/ale",human
"Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has become the standard algorithm for training machine learning models with rigorous privacy guarantees. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.",human
"We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.",human
"Ensuring that agents satisfy safety specifications can be crucial in safety-critical environments. While methods exist for controller synthesis with safe temporal specifications, most existing methods restrict safe temporal specifications to probabilistic-avoidance constraints. Formal methods typically offer more expressive ways to express safety in probabilistic systems, such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas. Thus, in this paper, we develop a new approach that supports more general temporal properties expressed in PCTL. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical framework for the Synthesis of safe-PCTL specifications. We show how the reducing global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and define CPCTL, a fragment of safe-PCTL. We demonstrate how the expressiveness of CPCTL makes it a relevant fragment for the Synthesis Problem. Second, we leverage these results and propose a new Value Iteration-based algorithm to solve the synthesis problem for these more general temporal properties, and we prove the soundness and completeness of our method.",human
"Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.",human
"We propose ECPv2, a scalable and theoretically grounded algorithm for global optimization of Lipschitz-continuous functions with unknown Lipschitz constants. Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.",human
"Neural operators have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in accelerating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning governing physical laws from data. However, for PDEs governed by conservation laws(e.g., conservation of mass, energy, or matter), existing neural operators fail to satisfy conservation properties, which leads to degraded model performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, we observe that distinct PDE problems generally require different optimal neural network architectures. This finding underscores the inherent limitations of specialized models in generalizing across diverse problem domains.   To address these limitations, we propose Exterior-Embedded Conservation Framework (ECF), a universal conserving framework that can be integrated with various data-driven neural operators to enforce conservation laws strictly in predictions. The framework consists of two key components: a conservation quantity encoder that extracts conserved quantities from input data, and a conservation quantity decoder that adjusts the neural operator's predictions using these quantities to ensure strict conservation compliance in the final output. Since our architecture enforces conservation laws, we theoretically prove that it enhances model performance. To validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on multiple conservation-law-constrained PDE scenarios, including adiabatic systems, shallow water equations, and the Allen-Cahn problem. These baselines demonstrate that our method effectively improves model accuracy while strictly enforcing conservation laws in the predictions.",human
"Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.",human
"Our study provides a full deep learning system for automated classification of brain tumors from MRI images, includes six benchmarked architectures (five ImageNet-pre-trained models (VGG-16, Inception V3, ResNet-50, Inception-ResNet V2, Xception) and a custom built, compact CNN (1.31M params)). The study moves the needle forward in a number of ways, including (1) full standardization of assessment with respect to preprocessing, training sets/protocols (optimizing networks with the AdamW optimizer, CosineAnnealingLR, patiene for early stopping = 7), and metrics to assess performance were identical along all models; (2) a high level of confidence in the localizations based on prior studies as both Grad-CAM and GradientShap explanation were used to establish anatomically important and meaningful attention regions and address the black-box issue; (3) a compact 1.31 million parameter CNN was developed that achieved 96.49% testing accuracy and was 100 times smaller than Inception-ResNet V2 while permitting real-time inference (375ms) on edge devices; (4) full evaluation beyond accuracy reporting based on measures of intersection over union, Hausdorff distance, and precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices across all splits. Inception-ResNet V2 reached state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 99.53% accuracy on testing and obtaining a precision, recall, and F1-score of at least 99.50% dominant performance based on metrics of recent studies. We demonstrated a lightweight model that is suitable to deploy on devices that do not have multi-GPU infrastructure in under-resourced settings. This end-to-end solution considers accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of trustworthy AI to create the framework necessary for performance assessment and deployment within advance and low-resource healthcare systems to an extent that enabled participation at the clinical screening and triage level.",human
"Child malnutrition remains a global crisis, yet existing screening methods are laborious and poorly scalable, hindering early intervention. In this work, we present NutriScreener, a retrieval-augmented, multi-pose graph attention network that combines CLIP-based visual embeddings, class-boosted knowledge retrieval, and context awareness to enable robust malnutrition detection and anthropometric prediction from children's images, simultaneously addressing generalizability and class imbalance. In a clinical study, doctors rated it 4.3/5 for accuracy and 4.6/5 for efficiency, confirming its deployment readiness in low-resource settings. Trained and tested on 2,141 children from AnthroVision and additionally evaluated on diverse cross-continent populations, including ARAN and an in-house collected CampusPose dataset, it achieves 0.79 recall, 0.82 AUC, and significantly lower anthropometric RMSEs, demonstrating reliable measurement in unconstrained pediatric settings. Cross-dataset results show up to 25% recall gain and up to 3.5 cm RMSE reduction using demographically matched knowledge bases. NutriScreener offers a scalable and accurate solution for early malnutrition detection in low-resource environments.",human
"In this study, we design a reservoir computing (RC) network by exploiting short- and long-term memory dynamics in Au/Ti/MoS$_2$/Au memristive devices. The temporal dynamics is engineered by controlling the thickness of the Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) MoS$_2$ films. Devices with a monolayer (1L)-MoS$_2$ film exhibit volatile (short-term memory) switching dynamics. We also report non-volatile resistance switching with excellent uniformity and analog behavior in conductance tuning for the multilayer (ML) MoS$_2$ memristive devices. We correlate this performance with trap-assisted space-charge limited conduction (SCLC) mechanism, leading to a bulk-limited resistance switching behavior. Four-bit reservoir states are generated using volatile memristors. The readout layer is implemented with an array of nonvolatile synapses. This small RC network achieves 89.56\% precision in a spoken-digit recognition task and is also used to analyze a nonlinear time series equation.",human
"Clinical trials face mounting challenges: fragmented patient populations, slow enrollment, and unsustainable costs, particularly for late phase trials in oncology and rare diseases. While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.",human
"Universal approximation serves as the foundation of neural network learning algorithms. However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence. Three versions of incremental BSCRLS algorithms are presented to satisfy the application requirements of various network updates. Solar panels dust detection experiments are performed on publicly available dataset and compared with 13 deep and broad learning algorithms. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness and superiority of BSCRLS algorithms.",human
"As deep learning (DL) techniques become integral to various applications, ensuring model fairness while maintaining high performance has become increasingly critical, particularly in sensitive fields such as medical diagnosis. Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work utilizing SVD not primarily for compression but for fairness enhancement.",human
"Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.",human
"As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA through DSPy to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.",human
"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into explainable recommendation systems often leads to a performance-efficiency trade-off in end-to-end architectures, where joint optimization of ranking and explanation can result in suboptimal compromises. To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage.   Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.   Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.",human
"The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.   This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.   With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70% and 4.27% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.",human
"Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.",human
"Time-series forecasting is fundamental across many domains, yet training accurate models often requires large-scale datasets and substantial computational resources. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.   In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead. All code and distilled datasets will be released.",human
"Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.",human
"Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.",human
"Conflict resolution and consensus building represent critical challenges in multi-agent systems, negotiations, and collaborative decision-making processes. This paper introduces Dialogue Diplomats, a novel end-to-end multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed for automated conflict resolution and consensus building in complex, dynamic environments. The proposed system integrates advanced deep reinforcement learning architectures with dialogue-based negotiation protocols, enabling autonomous agents to engage in sophisticated conflict resolution through iterative communication and strategic adaptation. We present three primary contributions: first, a novel Hierarchical Consensus Network (HCN) architecture that combines attention mechanisms with graph neural networks to model inter-agent dependencies and conflict dynamics. second, a Progressive Negotiation Protocol (PNP) that structures multi-round dialogue interactions with adaptive concession strategies; and third, a Context-Aware Reward Shaping mechanism that balances individual agent objectives with collective consensus goals.",human
"Federated learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a shared model in a distributed manner, setting it apart from traditional deep learning paradigms. However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.",human
"Foundation flow-matching (FM) models promise a universal prior for solving inverse problems (IPs), yet today they trail behind domain-specific or even untrained priors. How can we unlock their potential? We introduce FMPlug, a plug-in framework that redefines how foundation FMs are used in IPs. FMPlug combines an instance-guided, time-dependent warm-start strategy with a sharp Gaussianity regularization, adding problem-specific guidance while preserving the Gaussian structures. This leads to a significant performance boost across image restoration and scientific IPs. Our results point to a path for making foundation FM models practical, reusable priors for IP solving.",human
"We open-source MiMo-Embodied, the first cross-embodied foundation model to successfully integrate and achieve state-of-the-art performance in both Autonomous Driving and Embodied AI. MiMo-Embodied sets new records across 17 embodied AI benchmarks in Task Planning, Affordance Prediction and Spatial Understanding, while also excelling in 12 autonomous driving benchmarks across Environmental Perception, Status Prediction, and Driving Planning. Across these tasks, MiMo-Embodied significantly outperforms existing open-source, closed-source, and specialized baselines. Our results indicate that through multi-stage learning, curated data construction, and CoT/RL fine-tuning, these two domains exhibit strong positive transfer and mutually reinforce one another. We provide a detailed analysis of our model design and training methodologies to facilitate further research. Code and models are available at https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Embodied.",human
"Incorrectly labelled training data are frustratingly ubiquitous in both benchmark and specially curated datasets. Such mislabelling clearly adversely affects the performance and generalizability of models trained through supervised learning on the associated datasets. Frameworks for detecting label errors typically require well-trained / well-generalized models; however, at the same time most frameworks rely on training these models on corrupt data, which clearly has the effect of reducing model generalizability and subsequent effectiveness in error detection -- unless a training scheme robust to label errors is employed. We evaluate two novel loss functions, Blurry Loss and Piecewise-zero Loss, that enhance robustness to label errors by de-weighting or disregarding difficult-to-classify samples, which are likely to be erroneous. These loss functions leverage the idea that mislabelled examples are typically more difficult to classify and should contribute less to the learning signal. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of artificially corrupted datasets demonstrate that the proposed loss functions outperform state-of-the-art robust loss functions in nearly all cases, achieving superior F1 scores for error detection. Further analyses through ablation studies offer insights to confirm these loss functions' broad applicability to cases of both uniform and non-uniform corruption, and with different label error detection frameworks. By using these robust loss functions, machine learning practitioners can more effectively identify, prune, or correct errors in their training data.",human
"In recent years, increasingly large models have achieved outstanding performance across CV tasks. However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.",human
"Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.",human
"Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search performance is transient during iterations and prone to degradation. Dynamic operators aim to address this but typically rely on predefined designs and localized parameter control during the search process, lacking adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for Evolutionary Optimization (LLM4EO), comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, initialization of operators is performed by transferring the strengths of classical operators via LLMs. Then, search preferences and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance and evolutionary features, accompanied by corresponding suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, gene selection priorities of operators are dynamically optimized via improvement prompting strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of populations and operators in the search, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, a series of validations on multiple benchmark datasets of the flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms both mainstream evolutionary programming and traditional EAs.",human
"Designing rewards for autonomous cyber attack and defense learning agents in a complex, dynamic environment is a challenging task for subject matter experts. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.",human
"Explainable AI (XAI) is increasingly essential as modern models become more complex and high-stakes applications demand transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance. Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \textsc{BlockCIR}, a \emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \emph{computationally efficient}, \emph{consistent}, and \emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.",human
"Music Recommender Systems (MRS) have long relied on an information-retrieval framing, where progress is measured mainly through accuracy on retrieval-oriented subtasks. While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators.   This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music. We then examine evaluation practices from NLP, highlighting methodologies and open challenges relevant to MRS. Finally, we synthesize insights-focusing on how LLM prompting applies to MRS, to outline a structured set of success and risk dimensions. Our goal is to provide the MRS community with an updated, pedagogical, and cross-disciplinary perspective on evaluation.",human
"Scalarisation functions are widely employed in MORL algorithms to enable intelligent decision-making. However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.",human
"The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.",human
"Arctic-Extract is a state-of-the-art model designed for extracting structural data (question answering, entities and tables) from scanned or digital-born business documents. Despite its SoTA capabilities, the model is deployable on resource-constrained hardware, weighting only 6.6 GiB, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources, such as A10 GPUs with 24 GB of memory. Arctic-Extract can process up to 125 A4 pages on those GPUs, making suitable for long document processing. This paper highlights Arctic-Extract's training protocols and evaluation results, demonstrating its strong performance in document understanding.",human
"This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.",human
"We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.",human
"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.",human
"People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.",human

ESGBench aims to accelerate research in transparent and accountable ESG-focused AI systems.",human
"The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",human
"Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.   Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.   Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.   Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.",human
"Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.",human
"Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is fundamental to applications ranging from urban mobility and resource management to climate modeling. While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods",human
"Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.",human
"Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.",human
"This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.",human
"Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.",human
"Wearable sensor technologies and deep learning are transforming healthcare management. Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.",human
"While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.",human
"Robots today often miss a key ingredient of truly intelligent behavior: the ability to reflect on their own cognitive processes and decisions. In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme. Confidence-informed robots can evaluate the reliability of their decisions, improving their robustness during real-world physical deployment. This form of robotic metacognition emphasizes embodied action monitoring as a means to achieve better informed decisions. We also highlight potential applications and research directions for robot metacognition.",human
"Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.",human
"We investigate how to optimally design local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms that reduce data unfairness and thereby improve fairness in downstream classification. We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes. Taken together, these results highlight LDP as a principled and effective pre-processing fairness intervention technique.",human
"The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.",human
"Foundation models have shown promise across various financial applications, yet their effectiveness for corporate bankruptcy prediction remains systematically unevaluated against established methods. We study bankruptcy forecasting using Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and TabPFN, evaluated on large, highly imbalanced datasets of over one million company records from the Visegrád Group. We provide the first systematic comparison of foundation models against classical machine learning baselines for this task. Our results show that models such as XGBoost and CatBoost consistently outperform foundation models across all prediction horizons. LLM-based approaches suffer from unreliable probability estimates, undermining their use in risk-sensitive financial settings. TabPFN, while competitive with simpler baselines, requires substantial computational resources with costs not justified by performance gains. These findings suggest that, despite their generality, current foundation models remain less effective than specialized methods for bankruptcy forecasting.",human
"Multipatterning is an essential decomposition strategy in electronic design automation (EDA) that overcomes lithographic limitations when printing dense circuit layouts. Although heuristic-based backtracking and SAT solvers can address these challenges, they often struggle to simultaneously handle both complex constraints and secondary objectives. In this study, we present a hybrid workflow that casts multipatterning as a variant of a constrained graph coloring problem with the primary objective of minimizing feature violations and a secondary objective of balancing the number of features on each mask. Our pipeline integrates two main components: (1) A GNN-based agent, trained in an unsupervised manner to generate initial color predictions, which are refined by (2) refinement strategies (a GNN-based heuristic and simulated annealing) that together enhance solution quality and balance. Experimental evaluation in both proprietary data sets and publicly available open source layouts demonstrate complete conflict-free decomposition and consistent color balancing. The proposed framework provides a reproducible, data-efficient and deployable baseline for scalable layout decomposition in EDA workflows.",human
"Evaluating the quality of synthetic data remains a persistent challenge in the Android malware domain due to instability and the lack of standardization among existing metrics. This work integrates into MalDataGen a Super-Metric that aggregates eight metrics across four fidelity dimensions, producing a single weighted score. Experiments involving ten generative models and five balanced datasets demonstrate that the Super-Metric is more stable and consistent than traditional metrics, exhibiting stronger correlations with the actual performance of classifiers.",human
"Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.",human
"We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.",human
"Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.",human
"Scalable Gaussian process (GP) inference is essential for sequential decision-making tasks, yet improving GP scalability remains a challenging problem with many open avenues of research. This paper focuses on iterative GPs, where iterative linear solvers, such as conjugate gradients, stochastic gradient descent or alternative projections, are used to approximate the GP posterior. We propose a new method which improves solver convergence of a large linear system by leveraging the known solution to a smaller system contained within. This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.",human
"Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.",human
"Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.",human
"Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only ""simple"" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.",human
"With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.",human
"This work introduces a learning-enhanced observer (LEO) for linear time-invariant systems with uncertain dynamics. Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems. Codes are available at https://github.com/Hao-B-Shu/LTI_LEO.",human
"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.",human
"Optimal operation of chemical processes is vital for energy, resource, and cost savings in chemical engineering. The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.   In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.",human
"This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.   The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.   The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.",human
"Linear probes are widely used to interpret and evaluate neural representations, yet their reliability remains unclear, as probes may appear accurate in some regimes but collapse unpredictably in others. We uncover a spectral mechanism behind this phenomenon and formalize it as the Spectral Identifiability Principle (SIP), a verifiable Fisher-inspired condition for probe stability. When the eigengap separating task-relevant directions is larger than the Fisher estimation error, the estimated subspace concentrates and accuracy remains consistent, whereas closing this gap induces instability in a phase-transition manner. Our analysis connects eigengap geometry, sample size, and misclassification risk through finite-sample reasoning, providing an interpretable diagnostic rather than a loose generalization bound. Controlled synthetic studies, where Fisher quantities are computed exactly, confirm these predictions and show how spectral inspection can anticipate unreliable probes before they distort downstream evaluation.",human
"Machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data, such as molecular graphs or social networks, often make accurate predictions but offer little insight into why certain predictions are made. Counterfactual explanations address this challenge by seeking the closest alternative scenario where the model's prediction would change. Although counterfactual explanations are extensively studied in tabular data and computer vision, the graph domain remains comparatively underexplored. Constructing graph counterfactuals is intrinsically difficult because graphs are discrete and non-euclidean objects. We introduce Graph Diffusion Counterfactual Explanation, a novel framework for generating counterfactual explanations on graph data, combining discrete diffusion models and classifier-free guidance. We empirically demonstrate that our method reliably generates in-distribution as well as minimally structurally different counterfactuals for both discrete classification targets and continuous properties.",human
"Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.",human
"As LLMs become more common, non-expert users can pose risks, prompting extensive research into jailbreak attacks. However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture ""template-over-safety flip"": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.",human
"Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.",human
"Trajectory similarity retrieval is an important part of spatiotemporal data mining, however, existing methods have the following limitations: traditional metrics are computationally expensive, while learning-based methods suffer from substantial training costs and potential instability. This paper addresses these problems by proposing Geometric Prototype Trajectory Hashing (GeoPTH), a novel, lightweight, and non-learning framework for efficient category-based trajectory retrieval. GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, Hausdorff metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings. Critically, GeoPTH consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight, prototype-centric approach offers a practical and powerful alternative, achieving an exceptional retrieval performance and computational efficiency.",human
"This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.",human
"The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research. To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of ""exploration collapse"", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.",human
"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

"In this work, we consider the problem of a two-player zero-sum game. In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm. Our ablation studies demonstrate the effect of different values of the crucial successive over-relaxation parameter.",human
"Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.",human
"Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.",human
"Real-world agricultural distributions often suffer from severe class imbalance, typically following a long-tailed distribution. Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training. Specifically, we model the real-world distribution as Dirichlet-distributed random variables, effectively performing a prior augmentation during few-shot learning. Our experiments show that DirPA successfully shifts the decision boundary and stabilizes the training process by acting as a dynamic feature regularizer.",human
"The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

"System prompts are critical for guiding the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet they often contain proprietary logic or sensitive information, making them a prime target for extraction attacks. Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality.

By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.",human
"Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

"The importance of Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) has increased significantly in domains where data quality is poor or access is limited due to privacy and regulatory constraints. One such domain is recruitment, where publicly available datasets are scarce due to the sensitive nature of information typically found in curricula vitae, such as gender, disability status, or age. This lack of accessible, representative data presents a significant obstacle to the development of fair and transparent machine learning models, particularly ranking algorithms that require large volumes of data to effectively learn how to recommend candidates. In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. In this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.",human
"Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.",human
"We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.",human
"Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.",human
"Effective scientific communication depends on accurate citations that validate sources and guide readers to supporting evidence. Yet academic literature faces mounting challenges: semantic citation errors that misrepresent sources, AI-generated hallucinated references, and traditional citation formats that point to entire papers without indicating which sections substantiate specific claims. We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.",human
"We study online interval scheduling in the irrevocable setting, where each interval must be immediately accepted or rejected upon arrival. The objective is to maximize the total length of accepted intervals while ensuring that no two accepted intervals overlap. We consider this problem in a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to (machine-learned) predictions. The goal is to design algorithms that leverage these predictions to improve performance while maintaining robust guarantees in the presence of prediction errors.   Our main contribution is the SemiTrust-and-Switch framework, which provides a unified approach for combining prediction-based and classical interval scheduling algorithms. This framework applies to both deterministic and randomized algorithms and captures the trade-off between consistency (performance under accurate predictions) and robustness (performance under adversarial inputs). Moreover, we provide lower bounds, proving the tightness of this framework in particular settings.   We further design a randomized algorithm that smoothly interpolates between prediction-based and robust algorithms. This algorithm achieves both robustness and smoothness--its performance degrades gracefully with the quality of the prediction.",human
"Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. SpecActor achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast path (e.g., a smaller model) to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges in speculative rollout by (1) a \emph{dynamic decoupled speculation} execution method that maximizes the GPU computational efficiency to realize speedup for large-batch execution -- a configuration common in training but unfriendly to speculative execution and (2) a \emph{dynamic Best-of-N speculation} method that selects and combines different drafting methods according to the rollout progress. It substantially improves the speculation accuracy even when the best drafting method is unknown a priori, meanwhile without requiring adding extra computation resources. {\sys} is {1.7}\,$\times$ faster than veRL in end-to-end training, and is {1.3--1.5}\,$\times$ faster compared to baselines with speculative decoding.",human
"As Law Enforcement Agencies advance in cryptocurrency forensics, criminal actors aiming to conceal illicit fund movements increasingly turn to ""mixin"" services or privacy-based cryptocurrencies. Monero stands out as a leading choice due to its strong privacy preserving and untraceability properties, making conventional blockchain analysis ineffective. Understanding the behavior and operational patterns of criminal actors within Monero is therefore challenging and it is essential to support future investigative strategies and disrupt illicit activities. In this work, we propose a case study in which we leverage a novel graph-based methodology to extract structural and temporal patterns from Monero transactions linked to already discovered criminal activities. By building Address-Ring-Transaction graphs from flagged transactions, we extract structural and temporal features and use them to train Machine Learning models capable of detecting similar behavioral patterns that could highlight criminal modus operandi. This represents a first partial step toward developing analytical tools that support investigative efforts in privacy-preserving blockchain ecosystems",human
"Rumor detection on social media remains a challenging task due to the complex propagation dynamics and the limited interpretability of existing models. While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.",human
"Autonomous intelligence requires not only perception and reasoning, but critically, effective interaction with the existing world and its infrastructure. Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures). SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of training datasets. Benchmark resources are available at: https://github.com/BAAI-Agents/SWITCH.",human
"Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.",human
"Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.",human
"In unsupervised or weakly-supervised approaches for speech dereverberation, the target clean (dry) signals are considered to be unknown during training. In that context, evaluating to what extent information can be retrieved from the sole knowledge of reverberant (wet) speech becomes critical. This work investigates the role of the reverberant (wet) phase in the time-frequency domain. Based on Statistical Wave Field Theory, we show that late reverberation perturbs phase components with white, uniformly distributed noise, except at low frequencies. Consequently, the wet phase carries limited useful information and is not essential for weakly supervised dereverberation. To validate this finding, we train dereverberation models under a recent weak supervision framework and demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by excluding the reverberant phase from the loss function.",human
"Accurate and reliable wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, balancing supply and demand, and market risk management. Even though short-term weather forecasts have been thoroughly used to provide short-term renewable power predictions, forecasts involving longer prediction horizons still need investigations. Despite the recent progress in subseasonal-to-seasonal weather probabilistic forecasting, their use for wind power prediction usually involves both temporal and spatial aggregation achieve reasonable skill. In this study, we present a forecasting pipeline enabling to transform ECMWF subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts into wind power forecasts for lead times ranging from 1 day to 46 days at daily resolution. This framework also include post-processing of the resulting power ensembles to account for the biases and lack of dispersion of the weather forecasts. We show that our method is able to outperform a climatological baseline by 50 % in terms of both Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Ensemble Mean Squared Error while also providing near perfect calibration of the forecasts for lead times ranging from 15 to 46 days.",human
"Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences.

"Magnetic levitation is about to revolutionize in-machine material flow in industrial automation. Such systems are flexibly configurable and can include a large number of independently actuated shuttles (movers) that dynamically rebalance production capacity. Beyond their capabilities for dynamic transportation, these systems possess the inherent yet unexploited potential to perform manipulation. By merging the fields of transportation and manipulation into a coordinated swarm of magnetic robots (MagBots), we enable manufacturing systems to achieve significantly higher efficiency, adaptability, and compactness. To support the development of intelligent algorithms for magnetic levitation systems, we introduce MagBotSim (Magnetic Robotics Simulation): a physics-based simulation for magnetic levitation systems. By framing magnetic levitation systems as robot swarms and providing a dedicated simulation, this work lays the foundation for next generation manufacturing systems powered by Magnetic Robotics.

"Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.",human
"In recent years, there has been an increasing need for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) to improve flexibility in order to match the rapid growth of renewable energies. The Operator Assistance Predictive System (OAPS) developed by Framatome addresses this problem through Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this work, we aim to improve MPC methods through data-driven simulation schemes. Thus, from a set of nonlinear stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), this paper introduces two surrogate models acting as alternative simulation schemes to enhance nuclear reactor core simulation. We show that both data-driven and physics-informed models can rapidly integrate complex dynamics, with a very low computational time (up to 1000x time reduction).",human
"In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.",human
"Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice offers transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical applicability remains constrained by critical alignment issues: (1) a misalignment between static evaluation benchmarks and the dynamic cognitive demands of clinical practice, (2) challenges in adapting to continuously evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the limited capacity of conventional reward models to reflect nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) with GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints)-a novel alignment framework that structured medical standards into a multi-perspective matrix to guide both data generation and model optimization. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a medical standard system that embeds domain-specific guidelines throughout the training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, transitioning from rule-based or LLM-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for better evaluation performance; and (3) geometric projection reference constraints that translate clinical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and facilitating training with synthetically generated data. Extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of the base Qwen-32B model, with improvements of 45% on the full subset and 85% on the hard subset. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source LLMs, scoring 62.7 (full) and 44.7 (hard), while also surpassing the majority of closed-source models.",human
"Metamaterials, known for their ability to manipulate light at subwavelength scales, face significant design challenges due to their complex and sophisticated structures. Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language. Our experiments demonstrate that CoSP can design corresponding thin-film metamaterial structures for arbitrary multi-state, multi-band optical responses, showing great potentials in the intelligent design of RMMs for versatile applications.",human
"Emotion recognition from social media is critical for understanding public sentiment, but accessing training data has become prohibitively expensive due to escalating API costs and platform restrictions. We introduce an interpretability-guided framework where Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provide principled guidance for LLM-based synthetic data generation. With sufficient seed data, SHAP-guided approach matches real data performance, significantly outperforms naïve generation, and substantially improves classification for underrepresented emotion classes. However, our linguistic analysis reveals that synthetic text exhibits reduced vocabulary richness and fewer personal or temporally complex expressions than authentic posts. This work provides both a practical framework for responsible synthetic data generation and a critical perspective on its limitations, underscoring that the future of trustworthy AI depends on navigating the trade-offs between synthetic utility and real-world authenticity.",human
"Interacting with relational databases remains challenging for users across different expertise levels, particularly when composing complex analytical queries or performing administrative tasks. Existing systems typically address either natural language querying or narrow aspects of database administration, lacking a unified and intelligent interface for general-purpose database interaction. We introduce AskDB, a large language model powered agent designed to bridge this gap by supporting both data analysis and administrative operations over SQL databases through natural language. Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of AskDB as a unified and intelligent agent for relational database systems, offering an intuitive and accessible experience for end users.",human
"Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial in industrial applications, yet existing approaches often struggle to generate long sequence parametric commands due to complex CAD models' geometric and topological constraints. To address this challenge, we propose MamTiff-CAD, a novel CAD parametric command sequences generation framework that leverages a Transformer-based diffusion model for multi-scale latent representations. Specifically, we design a novel autoencoder that integrates Mamba+ and Transformer, to transfer parameterized CAD sequences into latent representations. The Mamba+ block incorporates a forget gate mechanism to effectively capture long-range dependencies. The non-autoregressive Transformer decoder reconstructs the latent representations. A diffusion model based on multi-scale Transformer is then trained on these latent embeddings to learn the distribution of long sequence commands. In addition, we also construct a dataset that consists of long parametric sequences, which is up to 256 commands for a single CAD model. Experiments demonstrate that MamTiff-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both reconstruction and generation tasks, confirming its effectiveness for long sequence (60-256) CAD model generation.",human
"The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.",human
"Graph spectral representations are fundamental in graph signal processing, offering a rigorous framework for analyzing and processing graph-structured data. The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) extends the classical graph Fourier transform (GFT) with a fractional-order parameter, enabling flexible spectral analysis while preserving mathematical consistency. The angular graph Fourier transform (AGFT) introduces angular control via GFT eigenvector rotation; however, existing constructions fail to degenerate to the GFT at zero angle, which is a critical flaw that undermines theoretical consistency and interpretability. To resolve these complementary limitations - GFRFT's lack of angular regulation and AGFT's defective degeneracy - this study proposes an angular GFRFT (AGFRFT), a unified framework that integrates fractional-order and angular spectral analyses with theoretical rigor. A degeneracy-friendly rotation matrix family ensures exact GFT degeneration at zero angle, with two AGFRFT variants (I-AGFRFT and II-AGFRFT) defined accordingly. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm their unitarity, invertibility, and smooth parameter dependence. Both support learnable joint parameterization of the angle and fractional order, enabling adaptive spectral processing for diverse graph signals. Extensive experiments on real-world data denoising, image denoising, and point cloud denoising demonstrate that AGFRFT outperforms GFRFT and AGFT in terms of spectral concentration, reconstruction quality, and controllable spectral manipulation, establishing a robust and flexible tool for integrated angular fractional spectral analysis in graph signal processing.",human
"We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.   Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.",human
"In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.",human
"Trajectory generation has recently drawn growing interest in privacy-preserving urban mobility studies and location-based service applications. Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.   Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\%$ and $26.3\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising. Lastly, the framework design offers a significant efficiency advantage, saving $64.8\%$ of the time and $56.5\%$ of GPU memory compared to previous approaches.",human
"Spectral Graph Neural Networks offer a principled approach to graph filtering but face a fundamental ""Stability-vs-Adaptivity"" trade-off. This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a ""naive"" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as ""Instability Poisoning,"" where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses ""Late Fusion"" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.",human
"Deterministic policy gradient algorithms for continuous control suffer from value estimation biases that degrade performance. While double critics reduce such biases, the exploration potential of double actors remains underexplored. Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.",human
"Traditional threat modeling remains reactive-focused on known TTPs and past incident data, while threat prediction and forecasting frameworks are often disconnected from operational or architectural artifacts. This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.",human
"The performance of machine learning models in drug discovery is highly dependent on the quality and consistency of the underlying training data. Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery. AssayMatch is available at https://github.com/Ozymandias314/AssayMatch.",human
"Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models. Code is available at https://github.com/mh-zhou/SpectralTrain.",human
"Spectral GNNs, like ChebyNet, are limited by heterophily and over-smoothing due to their static, low-pass filter design. This work investigates the ""Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter"" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.",human
"Modern data processing workflows frequently encounter ragged data: collections with variable-length elements that arise naturally in domains like natural language processing, scientific measurements, and autonomous AI agents. Existing workflow engines lack native support for tracking the shapes and dependencies inherent to ragged data, forcing users to manage complex indexing and dependency bookkeeping manually. We present Operon, a Rust-based workflow engine that addresses these challenges through a novel formalism of named dimensions with explicit dependency relations. Operon provides a domain-specific language where users declare pipelines with dimension annotations that are statically verified for correctness, while the runtime system dynamically schedules tasks as data shapes are incrementally discovered during execution. We formalize the mathematical foundation for reasoning about partial shapes and prove that Operon's incremental construction algorithm guarantees deterministic and confluent execution in parallel settings. The system's explicit modeling of partially-known states enables robust persistence and recovery mechanisms, while its per-task multi-queue architecture achieves efficient parallelism across heterogeneous task types. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Operon outperforms an existing workflow engine with 14.94x baseline overhead reduction while maintaining near-linear end-to-end output rates as workloads scale, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data generation pipelines in machine learning applications.",human
"Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable",human
"Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable ""gentle polishing process"" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.",human
"Mechanistic interpretability aspires to reverse-engineer neural networks into explicit algorithms, while model editing seeks to modify specific behaviours without retraining. Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour.",human
"AI models like GPT-5 are an increasingly valuable tool for scientists, but many remain unaware of the capabilities of frontier AI. We present a collection of short case studies in which GPT-5 produced new, concrete steps in ongoing research across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science. In these examples, the authors highlight how AI accelerated their work, and where it fell short; where expert time was saved, and where human input was still key. We document the interactions of the human authors with GPT-5, as guiding examples of fruitful collaboration with AI. Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.",human
"Federated Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) faces three critical challenges under client heterogeneity: (1) Initialization-Induced Instability due to random initialization misaligning client subspaces; (2) Rank Incompatibility and Aggregation Error when averaging LoRA parameters of different ranks, which biases the global model; and (3) exacerbated Client Drift under Non-IID Data, impairing generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift. Supported by theoretical convergence guarantees, extensive experiments on vision and NLP benchmarks demonstrate that ILoRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability compared to existing federated LoRA methods.",human
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on homophilous graphs but often fail under heterophily due to self-reinforcing and phase-inconsistent signals. We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing. Our code is available at \href{here}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GESC-1B22}.",human
"Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.",human
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.",human
"Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.",human
"While mainstream robotics pursues metric precision and flawless performance, this paper explores the creative potential of a deliberately ""lo-fi"" approach. We present the ""Semantic Glitch,"" a soft flying robotic art installation whose physical form, a 3D pixel style cloud, is a ""physical glitch"" derived from digital archaeology. We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a ""narrative mind"" that complements the ""weak,"" historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling ""plan to execution"" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception. This demonstrates a lo-fi framework for creating imperfect companions whose success is measured in character over efficiency.",human
"In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.",human
"Large Language Model (LLM) Agents, often trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), are constrained by a dependency on human-curated data, limiting scalability and tethering AI to human knowledge. Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

"Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.",human
"Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.",human
"Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.",human
"Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the secure deployment of large language models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to implant hidden behaviors triggered by specific inputs. However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \textit{Bias Recommendation}, \textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

"Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.",human
"LLMs generate buggy code: 29.6% of SWE-bench ""solved"" patches fail, 62% of BaxBench solutions have vulnerabilities, and existing tools only catch 65% of bugs with 35% false positives. We built CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system that uses four specialized agents to detect different types of bugs. We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, confirmed by measuring agent correlation of p = 0.05--0.25. We also show that multiple vulnerabilities in the same code create exponentially more risk than previously thought--SQL injection plus exposed credentials creates 15x more danger (risk 300 vs. 20) than traditional models predict. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method while running faster and without test execution. We tested 15 different agent combinations and found that using multiple agents improves accuracy by 39.7 percentage points (from 32.8% to 72.4%) compared to single agents, with gains of +14.9pp, +13.5pp, and +11.2pp for agents 2, 3, and 4. The best two-agent combination reaches 79.3% accuracy. Testing on 300 real patches from Claude Sonnet 4.5 runs in under 200ms per sample, making this practical for production use.",human

This paper surveys hybrid architectures, ethical design considerations, and deployment patterns that balance accuracy with accountability. We highlight techniques for integrating knowledge graphs with deep inference, embedding fairness-aware rules, and generating human-readable explanations. Through case studies in healthcare decision support, financial risk management, and autonomous infrastructure, we show how hybrid systems can deliver reliable and auditable AI.

"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.",human
"Digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector has produced vast yet fragmented collections of artefact data. Existing frameworks for museum information systems struggle to integrate heterogeneous metadata, unstructured documents, and multimodal artefacts into a coherent and queryable form.

MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines. The results highlight the importance of symbolic grounding for interpretable and scalable cultural heritage reasoning, and pave the way for web-scale integration of digital heritage knowledge.",human
"High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.",human
"Estimating counterfactual outcomes from time-series observations is crucial for effective decision-making, e.g. when to administer a life-saving treatment, yet remains significantly challenging because (i) the counterfactual trajectory is never observed and (ii) confounders evolve with time and distort estimation at every step. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.",human
"Large language model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong performance on repository-level issue resolution, but existing systems are almost exclusively designed for Python and rely heavily on lexical retrieval and shallow code navigation. These approaches transfer poorly to C++ projects, where overloaded identifiers, nested namespaces, template instantiations, and deep control-flow structures make context retrieval and fault localization substantially more difficult. As a result, state-of-the-art Python-oriented agents show a drastic performance drop on the C++ subset of MultiSWE-bench. We introduce INFCODE-C++, the first C++-aware autonomous system for end-to-end issue resolution. The system combines two complementary retrieval mechanisms -- semantic code-intent retrieval and deterministic AST-structured querying -- to construct accurate, language-aware context for repair.These components enable precise localization and robust patch synthesis in large, statically typed C++ repositories. Evaluated on the \texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution. INFCODE-C++ highlights the need for language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents and establishes a foundation for future research on scalable, LLM-driven repair for complex, statically typed ecosystems.",human
"Large language models have advanced software engineering automation, yet resolving real-world software issues remains difficult because it requires repository-level reasoning, accurate diagnostics, and strong verification signals. Existing agent-based and pipeline-based methods often rely on insufficient tests, which can lead to patches that satisfy verification but fail to fix the underlying defect. We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue resolution. InfCode iteratively refines both tests and patches through adversarial interaction between a Test Patch Generator and a Code Patch Generator, while a Selector agent identifies the most reliable fix. The framework runs inside a containerized environment that supports realistic repository inspection, modification, and validation. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified using models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show that InfCode consistently outperforms strong baselines. It achieves 79.4% performance on SWE-bench Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art. We have released InfCode as an open-source project at https://github.com/Tokfinity/InfCode.",human
"Generative AI is reshaping offensive cybersecurity by enabling autonomous red team agents that can plan, execute, and adapt during penetration tests. However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.",human
"Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.",human
"We present QueryGym, a lightweight, extensible Python toolkit that supports large language model (LLM)-based query reformulation. This is an important tool development since recent work on llm-based query reformulation has shown notable increase in retrieval effectiveness. However, while different authors have sporadically shared the implementation of their methods, there is no unified toolkit that provides a consistent implementation of such methods, which hinders fair comparison, rapid experimentation, consistent benchmarking and reliable deployment. QueryGym addresses this gap by providing a unified framework for implementing, executing, and comparing llm-based reformulation methods. The toolkit offers: (1) a Python API for applying diverse LLM-based methods, (2) a retrieval-agnostic interface supporting integration with backends such as Pyserini and PyTerrier, (3) a centralized prompt management system with versioning and metadata tracking, (4) built-in support for benchmarks like BEIR and MS MARCO, and (5) a completely open-source extensible implementation available to all researchers. QueryGym is publicly available at https://github.com/radinhamidi/QueryGym.",human
"Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as ""sleeper agents."" Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.",human
"Digital agriculture is transforming the way we grow food by utilizing technology to make farming more efficient, sustainable, and productive. This modern approach to agriculture generates a wealth of valuable data that could help address global food challenges, but farmers are hesitant to share it due to privacy concerns. This limits the extent to which researchers can learn from this data to inform improvements in farming. This paper presents the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, a secure online platform that solves this problem. The platform enables farmers (with limited technical resources) and researchers to collaborate on analyzing farm data without exposing private information. We employ specialized techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to safeguard the data while maintaining its utility for research purposes. The system enables farmers to identify similar farmers in a simplified manner without needing extensive technical knowledge or access to computational resources. Similarly, it enables researchers to learn from the data and build helpful tools without the sensitive information ever leaving the farmer's system. This creates a safe space where farmers feel comfortable sharing data, allowing researchers to make important discoveries. Our platform helps bridge the gap between maintaining farm data privacy and utilizing that data to address critical food and farming challenges worldwide.",human
"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.",human
"Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete"" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete"" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning"" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(ε, δ)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(ε, δ)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.",human
"The lack of epidemiological data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a fundamental difficulty in constructing robust models to forecast and mitigate threats such as viruses and worms. Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.",human
"Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.",human
"In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.",human
"Evaluating adherence to PRISMA 2020 guideline remains a burden in the peer review process. To address the lack of shareable benchmarks, we constructed a copyright-aware benchmark of 108 Creative Commons-licensed systematic reviews and evaluated ten large language models (LLMs) across five input formats. In a development cohort, supplying structured PRISMA 2020 checklists (Markdown, JSON, XML, or plain text) yielded 78.7-79.7% accuracy versus 45.21% for manuscript-only input (p less than 0.0001), with no differences between structured formats (p>0.9). Across models, accuracy ranged from 70.6-82.8% with distinct sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, replicated in an independent validation cohort. We then selected Qwen3-Max (a high-sensitivity open-weight model) and extended evaluation to the full dataset (n=120), achieving 95.1% sensitivity and 49.3% specificity. Structured checklist provision substantially improves LLM-based PRISMA assessment, though human expert verification remains essential before editorial decisions.",human
"Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles,host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials,and the severity of infection. This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.",human
"Quantum machine learning (QML) is a computational paradigm that seeks to apply quantum-mechanical resources to solve learning problems. As such, the goal of this framework is to leverage quantum processors to tackle optimization, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and generative modeling-among other tasks-more efficiently than classical models. Here we offer a high level overview of QML, focusing on settings where the quantum device is the primary learning or data generating unit. We outline the field's tensions between practicality and guarantees, access models and speedups, and classical baselines and claimed quantum advantages-flagging where evidence is strong, where it is conditional or still lacking, and where open questions remain. By shedding light on these nuances and debates, we aim to provide a friendly map of the QML landscape so that the reader can judge when-and under what assumptions-quantum approaches may offer real benefits.",human
"Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.",human
"We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.",human
"Binary options trading is often marketed as a field where predictive models can generate consistent profits. However, the inherent randomness and stochastic nature of binary options make price movements highly unpredictable, posing significant challenges for any forecasting approach. This study demonstrates that machine learning algorithms struggle to outperform a simple baseline in predicting binary options movements. Using a dataset of EUR/USD currency pairs from 2021 to 2023, we tested multiple models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), both before and after hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, several neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, were evaluated under different training conditions. Despite these exhaustive efforts, none of the models surpassed the ZeroR baseline accuracy, highlighting the inherent randomness of binary options. These findings reinforce the notion that binary options lack predictable patterns, making them unsuitable for machine learning-based forecasting.",human
"While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.",human

"Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.",human
"Tabular data underpins decisions across science, industry, and public services. Despite rapid progress, advances in deep learning have not fully carried over to the tabular domain, where gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) remain a default choice in practice. We present iLTM, an integrated Large Tabular Model that unifies tree-derived embeddings, dimensionality-agnostic representations, a meta-trained hypernetwork, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and retrieval within a single architecture. Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning. By bridging the gap between tree-based and neural methods, iLTM offers a new framework for tabular foundation models for robust, adaptable, and scalable tabular learning.",human
"Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.",human
"This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.",human
"We present AccelOpt, a self-improving large language model (LLM) agentic system that autonomously optimizes kernels for emerging AI acclerators, eliminating the need for expert-provided hardware-specific optimization knowledge.

We build NKIBench, a new benchmark suite of AWS Trainium accelerator kernels with varying complexity extracted from real-world LLM workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of AccelOpt. Our evaluation confirms that AccelOpt's capability improves over time, boosting the average percentage of peak throughput from $49\%$ to $61\%$ on Trainium 1 and from $45\%$ to $59\%$ on Trainium 2 for NKIBench kernels. Moreover, AccelOpt is highly cost-effective: using open-source models, it matches the kernel improvements of Claude Sonnet 4 while being $26\times$ cheaper.",human
"Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.",human
"An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...",human
"Speculative sampling reduces the latency of autoregressive decoding for target model LLMs without sacrificing inference quality, by using a cheap draft model to suggest a candidate token and a verification criterion to accept or resample this token. To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.",human
"Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.",human
"Our ability to interpret others' mental states through nonverbal cues (NVCs) is fundamental to our survival and social cohesion. While existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks have primarily focused on false-belief tasks and reasoning with asymmetric information, they overlook other mental states beyond belief and the rich tapestry of human nonverbal communication. We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.",human
"This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.",human
"Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.   To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.",human
"Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.",human
"Underground pipeline leaks and infiltrations pose significant threats to water security and environmental safety. Traditional manual inspection methods provide limited coverage and delayed response, often missing critical anomalies. This paper proposes AquaSentinel, a novel physics-informed AI system for real-time anomaly detection in urban underground water pipeline networks. We introduce four key innovations: (1) strategic sparse sensor deployment at high-centrality nodes combined with physics-based state augmentation to achieve network-wide observability from minimal infrastructure; (2) the RTCA (Real-Time Cumulative Anomaly) detection algorithm, which employs dual-threshold monitoring with adaptive statistics to distinguish transient fluctuations from genuine anomalies; (3) a Mixture of Experts (MoE) ensemble of spatiotemporal graph neural networks that provides robust predictions by dynamically weighting model contributions; (4) causal flow-based leak localization that traces anomalies upstream to identify source nodes and affected pipe segments. Our system strategically deploys sensors at critical network junctions and leverages physics-based modeling to propagate measurements to unmonitored nodes, creating virtual sensors that enhance data availability across the entire network. Experimental evaluation using 110 leak scenarios demonstrates that AquaSentinel achieves 100% detection accuracy. This work advances pipeline monitoring by demonstrating that physics-informed sparse sensing can match the performance of dense deployments at a fraction of the cost, providing a practical solution for aging urban infrastructure.",human
"This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and analyzing how uncooperative behaviors can destabilize or collapse LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds. These findings demonstrate that uncooperative agents can significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.",human
"Similar to social media bots that shape public opinion, healthcare and financial decisions, LLM-based ChatBots like ChatGPT can persuade users to alter their behavior. Unlike prior work that persuades via overt-partisan bias or misinformation, we test whether framing alone suffices. We conducted a crowdsourced study, where 336 participants interacted with a neutral or one of two value-framed ChatBots while deciding to alter US defense spending. In this single policy domain with controlled content, participants exposed to value-framed ChatBots significantly changed their budget choices relative to the neutral control. When the frame misaligned with their values, some participants reinforced their original preference, revealing a potentially replicable backfire effect, originally considered rare in the literature. These findings suggest that value-framing alone lowers the barrier for manipulative uses of LLMs, revealing risks distinct from overt bias or misinformation, and clarifying risks to countering misinformation.",human
"We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.   On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the ""Full"" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the ""Scarce"" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.   In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.   These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).",human
"We present discretize_distributions, a Python package that efficiently constructs discrete approximations of Gaussian mixture distributions and provides guarantees on the approximation error in Wasserstein distance. The package implements state-of-the-art quantization methods for Gaussian mixture models and extends them to improve scalability. It further integrates complementary quantization strategies such as sigma-point methods and provides a modular interface that supports custom schemes and integration into control and verification pipelines for cyber-physical systems. We benchmark the package on various examples, including high-dimensional, large, and degenerate Gaussian mixtures, and demonstrate that discretize_distributions produces accurate approximations at low computational cost.",human
"Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.",human
"Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use.",human
"This research report addresses the absence of an actionable definition for Loss of Control (LoC) in AI systems by developing a novel taxonomy and preparedness framework. Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension.",human
"Online conformal prediction (OCP) wraps around any pre-trained predictor to produce prediction sets with coverage guarantees that hold irrespective of temporal dependencies or distribution shifts. However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.",human
"The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.",human
"Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making.

"IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.",human
"In real-world applications, data often reside in restricted domains with unknown boundaries, or as high-dimensional point clouds lying on a lower-dimensional, nontrivial, unknown manifold. Traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) struggle to capture the underlying geometry in such settings. Some existing methods assume a flat space embedded in a point cloud, which can be represented by a single latent chart (latent space), while others exhibit weak performance when the point cloud is sparse or irregularly sampled. The goal of this work is to address these challenges. The main contributions are twofold: (1) We establish the Atlas Brownian Motion (BM) framework for estimating the heat kernel on point clouds with unknown geometries and nontrivial topological structures; (2) Instead of directly using the heat kernel estimates, we construct a Riemannian corrected kernel by combining the global heat kernel with local RBF kernel and leading to the formulation of Riemannian-corrected Atlas Gaussian Processes (RC-AGPs). The resulting RC-AGPs are applied to regression tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets. These examples demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both heat kernel estimation and regression accuracy. It improves statistical inference by effectively bridging the gap between complex, high-dimensional observations and manifold-based inferences.",human
"We introduce a new low-noise condition for classification, the Model Margin Noise (MM noise) assumption, and derive enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds under this condition. MM noise is weaker than Tsybakov noise condition: it is implied by Tsybakov noise condition but can hold even when Tsybakov fails, because it depends on the discrepancy between a given hypothesis and the Bayes-classifier rather than on the intrinsic distributional minimal margin (see Figure 1 for an illustration of an explicit example). This hypothesis-dependent assumption yields enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds for both binary and multi-class classification. Our results extend the enhanced $\mathcal{H}$-consistency bounds of Mao, Mohri, and Zhong (2025a) with the same favorable exponents but under a weaker assumption than the Tsybakov noise condition; they interpolate smoothly between linear and square-root regimes for intermediate noise levels. We also instantiate these bounds for common surrogate loss families and provide illustrative tables.",human
"Adversarially perturbed images of text can cause sophisticated OCR systems to produce misleading or incorrect transcriptions from seemingly invisible changes to humans. Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).",human
"Beyond the practical goal of improving search and measurement sensitivity through better jet tagging algorithms, there is a deeper question: what are their upper performance limits? Generative surrogate models with learned likelihood functions offer a new approach to this problem, provided the surrogate correctly captures the underlying data distribution. In this work, we introduce the SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF) method, a new approach to validating generative models. This framework enables exact Neyman-Pearson tests by training the target model on samples from another tractable surrogate, which is itself trained on real data. We argue that the EPiC-FM generative model is a valid surrogate reference for JetClass jets and apply SURF to show that modern jet taggers may already be operating close to the true statistical limit. By contrast, we find that autoregressive GPT models unphysically exaggerate top vs. QCD separation power encoded in the surrogate reference, implying that they are giving a misleading picture of the fundamental limit.",human
"Recent works have shown that tokenisation is NP-complete. However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: bottom-up tokenisation and direct tokenisation, where we must, respectively, select a sequence of merge operations or a vocabulary whose application optimally compresses a dataset. First, we note that proving hardness results for an $n$-ary alphabet proves the same results for alphabets of any larger size. We then prove that even with binary alphabets, both variants are not only NP-complete, but admit no polynomial-time approximation scheme (unless P=NP). We further show that direct tokenisation remains NP-complete even when applied to unary alphabets. While unary alphabets may not be practically useful, this result establishes that the computational intractability of tokenisation is not an artifact of large alphabets or complex constructions, but a fundamental barrier. Overall, our results explain why practical algorithms such as BPE and UnigramLM are heuristic, and points toward approximation algorithms being an important path going forward for tokenisation research.",human
"Egocentric videos are a valuable and scalable data source to learn manipulation policies. However, due to significant data heterogeneity, most existing approaches utilize human data for simple pre-training, which does not unlock its full potential. This paper first provides a scalable recipe for collecting and using egocentric data by categorizing human data into two categories: in-the-wild and on-task alongside with systematic analysis on how to use the data. We first curate a dataset, PHSD, which contains over 1,000 hours of diverse in-the-wild egocentric data and over 20 hours of on-task data directly aligned to the target manipulation tasks. This enables learning a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy, Human0. With domain adaptation techniques, Human0 minimizes the gap between humans and humanoids. Empirically, we show Human0 achieves several novel properties from scaling human data, including language following of instructions from only human data, few-shot learning, and improved robustness using on-task data.

"Abstract reasoning from minimal examples remains a core unsolved problem for frontier foundation models such as GPT-5 and Grok 4. These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33\% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models.

"In recent years, the Transformer architecture has achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and modalities. Token is the unified input and output representation in Transformer-based models, which has become a fundamental information unit. In this work, we consider the problem of token communication, studying how to transmit tokens efficiently and reliably. Point cloud, a prevailing three-dimensional format which exhibits a more complex spatial structure compared to image or video, is chosen to be the information source. We utilize the set abstraction method to obtain point tokens. Subsequently, to get a more informative and transmission-friendly representation based on tokens, we propose a joint semantic-channel and modulation (JSCCM) scheme for the token encoder, mapping point tokens to standard digital constellation points (modulated tokens). Specifically, the JSCCM consists of two parallel Point Transformer-based encoders and a differential modulator which combines the Gumel-softmax and soft quantization methods. Besides, the rate allocator and channel adapter are developed, facilitating adaptive generation of high-quality modulated tokens conditioned on both semantic information and channel conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both joint semantic-channel coding and traditional separate coding, achieving over 1dB gain in reconstruction and more than 6x compression ratio in modulated symbols.",human
"Food rescue organizations simultaneously tackle food insecurity and waste by working with volunteers to redistribute food from donors who have excess to recipients who need it. Volunteer feedback allows food rescue organizations to identify issues early and ensure volunteer satisfaction. However, food rescue organizations monitor feedback manually, which can be cumbersome and labor-intensive, making it difficult to prioritize which issues are most important. In this work, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) assist food rescue organizers in understanding and taking action based on volunteer experiences. We work with 412 Food Rescue, a large food rescue organization based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to design RescueLens, an LLM-powered tool that automatically categorizes volunteer feedback, suggests donors and recipients to follow up with, and updates volunteer directions based on feedback. We evaluate the performance of RescueLens on an annotated dataset, and show that it can recover 96% of volunteer issues at 71% precision. Moreover, by ranking donors and recipients according to their rates of volunteer issues, RescueLens allows organizers to focus on 0.5% of donors responsible for more than 30% of volunteer issues. RescueLens is now deployed at 412 Food Rescue and through semi-structured interviews with organizers, we find that RescueLens streamlines the feedback process so organizers better allocate their time.",human
"Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.",human
"Strong reasoning capabilities can now be achieved by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without any supervised fine-tuning. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) are well studied in the context of fine-tuning, how quantization impacts RL in large reasoning models (LRMs) remains an open question. To answer this question, we conducted systematic experiments and discovered a significant gap in reasoning performance on mathematical benchmarks between post-RL quantized models and their quantization-aware RL optimized counterparts. Our findings suggest that quantization-aware RL training negatively impacted the learning process, whereas PTQ and QLoRA led to greater performance.",human
"Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks, but they suffer from high computational inefficiency. To reduce inference overhead, expert skipping methods have been proposed to deactivate redundant experts based on the current input tokens. However, we find that applying these methods-originally designed for unimodal large language models (LLMs)-to MLLMs results in considerable performance degradation. This is primarily because such methods fail to account for the heterogeneous contributions of experts across MoE layers and modality-specific behaviors of tokens within these layers. Motivated by these findings, we propose MoDES, the first training-free framework that adaptively skips experts to enable efficient and accurate MoE MLLM inference. It incorporates a globally-modulated local gating (GMLG) mechanism that integrates global layer-wise importance into local routing probabilities to accurately estimate per-token expert importance. A dual-modality thresholding (DMT) method is then applied, which processes tokens from each modality separately, to derive the skipping schedule. To set the optimal thresholds, we introduce a frontier search algorithm that exploits monotonicity properties, cutting convergence time from several days to a few hours. Extensive experiments for 3 model series across 13 benchmarks demonstrate that MoDES far outperforms previous approaches. For instance, when skipping 88% experts for Qwen3-VL-MoE-30B-A3B-Instruct, the performance boost is up to 10.67% (97.33% vs. 86.66%). Furthermore, MoDES significantly enhances inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 2.16$\times$ and the decoding time by 1.26$\times$.",human
"Foundation models have transformed machine learning for language and vision, but achieving comparable impact in physical simulation remains a challenge. Data heterogeneity and unstable long-term dynamics inhibit learning from sufficiently diverse dynamics, while varying resolutions and dimensionalities challenge efficient training on modern hardware. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we incorporate new approaches to mitigate these obstacles, including a harmonic-analysis-based stabilization method, load-balanced distributed 2D and 3D training strategies, and compute-adaptive tokenization. Using these tools, we develop Walrus, a transformer-based foundation model developed primarily for fluid-like continuum dynamics. Walrus is pretrained on nineteen diverse scenarios spanning astrophysics, geoscience, rheology, plasma physics, acoustics, and classical fluids. Experiments show that Walrus outperforms prior foundation models on both short and long term prediction horizons on downstream tasks and across the breadth of pretraining data, while ablation studies confirm the value of our contributions to forecast stability, training throughput, and transfer performance over conventional approaches. Code and weights are released for community use.",human
"Front-door adjustment provides a simple closed-form identification formula under the classical front-door criterion, but its applicability is often viewed as narrow and strict. Although ID algorithm is very useful and is proved effective for causal relation identification in general causal graphs (if it is identifiable), performing ID algorithm does not guarantee to obtain a practical, easy-to-estimate interventional distribution expression. We argue that the applicability of the front-door criterion is not as limited as it seems: many more complicated causal graphs can be reduced to the front-door criterion. In this paper, We introduce front-door reducibility (FDR), a graphical condition on acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) that extends the applicability of the classic front-door criterion to reduce a large family of complicated causal graphs to a front-door setting by aggregating variables into super-nodes (FDR triple) $\left(\boldsymbol{X}^{*},\boldsymbol{Y}^{*},\boldsymbol{M}^{*}\right)$. After characterizing FDR criterion, we prove a graph-level equivalence between the satisfication of FDR criterion and the applicability of FDR adjustment. Meanwhile, we then present FDR-TID, an exact algorithm that detects an admissible FDR triple, together with established the algorithm's correctness, completeness, and finite termination. Empirically-motivated examples illustrate that many graphs outside the textbook front-door setting are FDR, yielding simple, estimable adjustments where general ID expressions would be cumbersome. FDR thus complements existing identification method by prioritizing interpretability and computational simplicity without sacrificing generality across mixed graphs.",human
"Depression is a prevalent global mental health disorder, characterised by persistent low mood and anhedonia. However, it remains underdiagnosed because current diagnostic methods depend heavily on subjective clinical assessments. To enable objective detection, we introduce a gold standard dataset of 103 clinically assessed participants collected through a tripartite data approach which uniquely integrated eye tracking data with audio and video to give a comprehensive representation of depressive symptoms. Eye tracking data quantifies the attentional bias towards negative stimuli that is frequently observed in depressed groups. Audio and video data capture the affective flattening and psychomotor retardation characteristic of depression. Statistical validation confirmed their significant discriminative power in distinguishing depressed from non depressed groups. We address a critical limitation of existing graph-based models that focus on low-frequency information and propose a Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN). This framework consists of a novel Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM), which can leverage both low and high frequency signals. Extensive evaluation against traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks demonstrates that MF-GCN consistently outperforms baselines. In binary classification, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94. For the 3 class classification task, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 and siginificantly suprassed other models. To validate generalizability, the model was also evaluated on the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) dataset and achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96. These results confirm that our trimodal, multi frequency framework effectively captures cross modal interaction for accurate depression detection.",human
"Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence. The project page is available at https://bruno686.github.io/VisPlay/",human
"Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) are transforming Earth Observation (EO), but evaluation lacks standardized protocols. GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks.   Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research. GEO-Bench-2 enables informed, reproducible GeoFM evaluation tailored to specific use cases. Code, data, and leaderboard for GEO-Bench-2 are publicly released under a permissive license.",human
"Continual learning (CL) is a branch of machine learning that aims to enable agents to adapt and generalise previously learned abilities so that these can be reapplied to new tasks or environments. This is particularly useful in multi-task settings or in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics can change over time. This is particularly relevant in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving. However, despite recent advances in CL, successfully applying it to reinforcement learning (RL) is still an open problem.   This paper highlights open challenges in continual RL (CRL) based on experiments in an autonomous driving environment. In this environment, the agent must learn to successfully park in four different scenarios corresponding to parking spaces oriented at varying angles. The agent is successively trained in these four scenarios one after another, representing a CL environment, using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These experiments exposed a number of open challenges in CRL: finding suitable abstractions of the environment, oversensitivity to hyperparameters, catastrophic forgetting, and efficient use of neural network capacity.   Based on these identified challenges, we present open research questions that are important to be addressed for creating robust CRL systems. In addition, the identified challenges call into question the suitability of neural networks for CL. We also identify the need for interdisciplinary research, in particular between computer science and neuroscience.",human
"With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in applying them to hardware design and verification. Among these stages, design verification remains the most time-consuming and resource-intensive phase, where generating effective stimuli for the design under test (DUT) is both critical and labor-intensive. We present {\it TB or not TB}, a framework for automated stimulus generation using LLMs fine-tuned through Coverage-Driven Direct Preference Optimization (CD-DPO). To enable preference-based training, we introduce PairaNet, a dataset derived from PyraNet that pairs high- and low-quality testbenches labeled using simulation-derived coverage metrics. The proposed CD-DPO method integrates quantitative coverage feedback directly into the optimization objective, guiding the model toward generating stimuli that maximize verification coverage. Experiments on the CVDP CID12 benchmark show that {\it TB or not TB} outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines, achieving up to 77.27\% improvement in code coverage, demonstrating the effectiveness of Coverage-driven preference optimization for LLM-based hardware verification.",human
"Characterizing the differential privacy (DP) of learning algorithms has become a major challenge in recent years. In parallel, many studies suggested investigating the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with heavy-tailed noise, both as a model for modern deep learning models and to improve their performance. However, most DP bounds focus on light-tailed noise, where satisfactory guarantees have been obtained but the proposed techniques do not directly extend to the heavy-tailed setting. Recently, the first DP guarantees for heavy-tailed SGD were obtained. These results provide $(0,δ)$-DP guarantees without requiring gradient clipping. Despite casting new light on the link between DP and heavy-tailed algorithms, these results have a strong dependence on the number of parameters and cannot be extended to other DP notions like the well-established Rényi differential privacy (RDP). In this work, we propose to address these limitations by deriving the first RDP guarantees for heavy-tailed SDEs, as well as their discretized counterparts. Our framework is based on new Rényi flow computations and the use of well-established fractional Poincaré inequalities. Under the assumption that such inequalities are satisfied, we obtain DP guarantees that have a much weaker dependence on the dimension compared to prior art.",human
"Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually while preserving past knowledge. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP offer transferable features via multi-modal pre-training, making them well-suited for CIL. However, real-world visual and linguistic concepts are inherently hierarchical: a textual concept like ""dog"" subsumes fine-grained categories such as ""Labrador"" and ""Golden Retriever,"" and each category entails its images. But existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to explicitly capture this inherent hierarchy, leading to fine-grained class features drift during incremental updates and ultimately to catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose HASTEN (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring) that anchors hierarchical information into CIL to reduce catastrophic forgetting. First, we employ an external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, effectively preserving hierarchical structure as data evolves. Second, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we project gradients onto the null space of the shared hyperbolic mapper, preventing interference with prior tasks. These two steps work synergistically to enable the model to resist forgetting by maintaining hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments show that HASTEN consistently outperforms existing methods while providing a unified structured representation.",human
"Data-driven methods for electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation are rapidly progressing. Large datasets have enabled advances in artificial intelligence (AI) based ECG analysis, yet limitations in annotation quality, size, and scope remain major challenges. Here we present CODE-II, a large-scale real-world dataset of 2,735,269 12-lead ECGs from 2,093,807 adult patients collected by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG), Brazil. Each exam was annotated using standardized diagnostic criteria and reviewed by cardiologists. A defining feature of CODE-II is a set of 66 clinically meaningful diagnostic classes, developed with cardiologist input and routinely used in telehealth practice. We additionally provide an open available subset: CODE-II-open, a public subset of 15,000 patients, and the CODE-II-test, a non-overlapping set of 8,475 exams reviewed by multiple cardiologists for blinded evaluation. A neural network pre-trained on CODE-II achieved superior transfer performance on external benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018) and outperformed alternatives trained on larger datasets.",human
"The notion of cause, as formalized by Halpern and Pearl, has been recently applied to relational databases, to characterize and compute causal explanations for query answers. In this work we consider the alternative notion of sufficient explanation. We investigate its connections with database repairs as used for dealing with inconsistent databases, and with causality-based necessary explanations. We also obtain some computational results.",human
"Automated video analysis is critical for wildlife conservation. A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild. The dataset is available at https://www.conservationxlabs.com/sa-fari.",human
"Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a conventional way to describe the observed dynamics of physical systems. Scientists typically hypothesize about dynamical behavior, propose a mathematical model, and compare its predictions to data. However, modern computing and algorithmic advances now enable purely data-driven learning of governing dynamics directly from observations. In data-driven settings, one learns the ODE's right-hand side (RHS). Dense measurements are often assumed, yet high temporal resolution is typically both cumbersome and expensive. Consequently, one usually has only sparsely sampled data. In this work we introduce ChaosODE (CODE), a Polynomial Chaos ODE Expansion in which we use an arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion (aPCE) for the ODE's right-hand side, resulting in a global orthonormal polynomial representation of dynamics. We evaluate the performance of CODE in several experiments on the Lotka-Volterra system, across varying noise levels, initial conditions, and predictions far into the future, even on previously unseen initial conditions. CODE exhibits remarkable extrapolation capabilities even when evaluated under novel initial conditions and shows advantages compared to well-examined methods using neural networks (NeuralODE) or kernel approximators (KernelODE) as the RHS representer. We observe that the high flexibility of NeuralODE and KernelODE degrades extrapolation capabilities under scarce data and measurement noise. Finally, we provide practical guidelines for robust optimization of dynamics-learning problems and illustrate them in the accompanying code.",human
"This paper presents a tractable algorithm for estimating an unknown Lipschitz function from noisy observations and establishes an upper bound on its convergence rate. The approach extends max-affine methods from convex shape-restricted regression to the more general Lipschitz setting. A key component is a nonlinear feature expansion that maps max-affine functions into a subclass of delta-convex functions, which act as universal approximators of Lipschitz functions while preserving their Lipschitz constants. Leveraging this property, the estimator attains the minimax convergence rate (up to logarithmic factors) with respect to the intrinsic dimension of the data under squared loss and subgaussian distributions in the random design setting. The algorithm integrates adaptive partitioning to capture intrinsic dimension, a penalty-based regularization mechanism that removes the need to know the true Lipschitz constant, and a two-stage optimization procedure combining a convex initialization with local refinement. The framework is also straightforward to adapt to convex shape-restricted regression. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance relative to other theoretically justified methods, including nearest-neighbor and kernel-based regressors.",human
"The integration of advanced robotics in nuclear power plants (NPPs) presents a transformative opportunity to enhance safety, efficiency, and environmental monitoring in high-stakes environments. Our paper introduces the Optimus-Q robot, a sophisticated system designed to autonomously monitor air quality and detect contamination while leveraging adaptive learning techniques and secure quantum communication. Equipped with advanced infrared sensors, the Optimus-Q robot continuously streams real-time environmental data to predict hazardous gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH$_4$). Utilizing a federated learning approach, the robot collaborates with other systems across various NPPs to improve its predictive capabilities without compromising data privacy. Additionally, the implementation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) ensures secure data transmission, safeguarding sensitive operational information. Our methodology combines systematic navigation patterns with machine learning algorithms to facilitate efficient coverage of designated areas, thereby optimizing contamination monitoring processes. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Optimus-Q robot in enhancing operational safety and responsiveness in nuclear facilities. This research underscores the potential of integrating robotics, machine learning, and quantum technologies to revolutionize monitoring systems in hazardous environments.",human
"Test-time thinking (that is, generating explicit intermediate reasoning chains) is known to boost performance in large language models and has recently shown strong gains for large vision language models (LVLMs). However, despite these promising results, there is still no systematic analysis of how thinking actually affects visual reasoning. We provide the first such analysis with a large scale, controlled comparison of thinking for LVLMs, evaluating ten variants from the InternVL3.5 and Qwen3-VL families on MMMU-val under generous token budgets and multi pass decoding. We show that more thinking is not always better; long chains often yield long wrong trajectories that ignore the image and underperform the same models run in standard instruct mode. A deeper analysis reveals that certain short lookback phrases, which explicitly refer back to the image, are strongly enriched in successful trajectories and correlate with better visual grounding. Building on this insight, we propose uncertainty guided lookback, a training free decoding strategy that combines an uncertainty signal with adaptive lookback prompts and breadth search. Our method improves overall MMMU performance, delivers the largest gains in categories where standard thinking is weak, and outperforms several strong decoding baselines, setting a new state of the art under fixed model families and token budgets. We further show that this decoding strategy generalizes, yielding consistent improvements on five additional benchmarks, including two broad multimodal suites and math focused visual reasoning datasets.",human
"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.",human
"Ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective solution for real-time visualization of spinal landmarks, paraspinal soft tissues and neurovascular structures, making it valuable for intraoperative guidance during spinal procedures. However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

"AI research agents offer the promise to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. However, the field is still in its infancy, and the key factors driving the success or failure of agent trajectories are not fully understood. We examine the role that ideation diversity plays in agent performance. First, we analyse agent trajectories on MLE-bench, a well-known benchmark to evaluate AI research agents, across different models and agent scaffolds. Our analysis reveals that different models and agent scaffolds yield varying degrees of ideation diversity, and that higher-performing agents tend to have increased ideation diversity. Further, we run a controlled experiment where we modify the degree of ideation diversity, demonstrating that higher ideation diversity results in stronger performance. Finally, we strengthen our results by examining additional evaluation metrics beyond the standard medal-based scoring of MLE-bench, showing that our findings still hold across other agent performance metrics.",human
"3D single object tracking (SOT) in LiDAR point clouds is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous driving. Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.",human
"Language acquisition is vital to revealing the nature of human language intelligence and has recently emerged as a promising perspective for improving the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

"Computer-Use Agents (CUA) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments through Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Yet, most GUI remain designed primarily for humans--prioritizing aesthetics and usability--forcing agents to adopt human-oriented behaviors that are unnecessary for efficient task execution. At the same time, rapid advances in coding-oriented language models (Coder) have transformed automatic GUI design. This raises a fundamental question: Can CUA as judges to assist Coder for automatic GUI design? To investigate, we introduce AUI-Gym, a benchmark for Automatic GUI development spanning 52 applications across diverse domains. Using language models, we synthesize 1560 tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. To ensure task reliability, we further develop a verifier that programmatically checks whether each task is executable within its environment. Building on this, we propose a Coder-CUA in Collaboration framework: the Coder acts as Designer, generating and revising websites, while the CUA serves as Judge, evaluating functionality and refining designs. Success is measured not by visual appearance, but by task solvability and CUA navigation success rate. To turn CUA feedback into usable guidance, we design a CUA Dashboard that compresses multi-step navigation histories into concise visual summaries, offering interpretable guidance for iterative redesign. By positioning agents as both designers and judges, our framework shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability. Our work takes a step toward shifting agents from passive use toward active participation in digital environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/showlab/AUI.",human
"Storing and processing of embedding vectors by specialized Vector databases (VDBs) has become the linchpin in building modern AI pipelines. Most current VDBs employ variants of a graph-based ap- proximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) index algorithm, HNSW, to an- swer semantic queries over stored vectors. Inspite of its wide-spread use, the HNSW algorithm suffers from several issues: in-memory design and implementation, random memory accesses leading to degradation in cache behavior, limited acceleration scope due to fine-grained pairwise computations, and support of only semantic similarity queries. In this paper, we present a novel disk-based ANN index, B+ANN, to address these issues: it first partitions input data into blocks containing semantically similar items, then builds an B+ tree variant to store blocks both in-memory and on disks, and finally, enables hybrid edge- and block-based in-memory traversals. As demonstrated by our experimantal evaluation, the proposed B+ANN disk-based index improves both quality (Recall value), and execution performance (Queries per second/QPS) over HNSW, by improving spatial and temporal locality for semantic operations, reducing cache misses (19.23% relative gain), and decreasing the memory consumption and disk-based build time by 24x over the DiskANN algorithm. Finally, it enables dissimilarity queries, which are not supported by similarity-oriented ANN indices.",human
"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce Mera Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking and licenses for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.",human
"Parameter estimation remains a challenging task across many areas of engineering. Because data acquisition can often be costly, limited, or prone to inaccuracies (noise, uncertainty) it is crucial to identify sensor configurations that provide the maximum amount of information about the unknown parameters, in particular for the case of distributed-parameter systems, where spatial variations are important. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a powerful machine-learning (ML) tool for parameter estimation, particularly in cases with sparse or noisy measurements, overcoming some of the limitations of traditional optimization-based and Bayesian approaches. Despite the widespread use of PINNs for solving inverse problems, relatively little attention has been given to how their performance depends on sensor placement. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive PINN-based framework that simultaneously tackles optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation. Our approach involves training a PINN model in which the parameters of interest are included as additional inputs. This enables the efficient computation of sensitivity functions through automatic differentiation, which are then used to determine optimal sensor locations exploiting the D-optimality criterion. The framework is validated on two illustrative distributed-parameter reaction-diffusion-advection problems of increasing complexity. The results demonstrate that our PINNs-based methodology consistently achieves higher accuracy compared to parameter values estimated from intuitively or randomly selected sensor positions.",human
"There is growing interest in using AI agents for scientific research, yet fundamental questions remain about their capabilities as scientists and reviewers.

Here, we discuss the key learnings from the conference and their implications for human-AI collaboration in science.",human
"In multi-objective optimization, multiple loss terms are weighted and added together to form a single objective. These weights are chosen to properly balance the competing losses according to some meta-goal. For example, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), these weights are often adaptively chosen to improve the network's generalization error. A popular choice of adaptive weights is based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of the PINN, which describes the evolution of the network in predictor space during training. The convergence of such an adaptive weighting algorithm is not clear a priori. Moreover, these NTK-based weights would be updated frequently during training, further increasing the computational burden of the learning process. In this paper, we prove that under appropriate conditions, gradient descent enhanced with adaptive NTK-based weights is convergent in a suitable sense. We then address the problem of computational efficiency by developing a randomized algorithm inspired by a predictor-corrector approach and matrix sketching, which produces unbiased estimates of the NTK up to an arbitrarily small discretization error. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and to show the efficacy of our randomized algorithm.

"Teams of cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) rely on acoustic communication for coordination, yet this communication medium is constrained by limited range, multi-path effects, and low bandwidth. One way to address the uncertainty associated with acoustic communication is to learn the communication environment in real-time. We address the challenge of a team of robots building a map of the probability of communication success from one location to another in real-time. This is a decentralized classification problem -- communication events are either successful or unsuccessful -- where AUVs share a subset of their communication measurements to build the map. The main contribution of this work is a rigorously derived data sharing policy that selects measurements to be shared among AUVs. We experimentally validate our proposed sharing policy using real acoustic communication data collected from teams of Virginia Tech 690 AUVs, demonstrating its effectiveness in underwater environments.",human
"Runtime geofencing for ground vehicles is rapidly emerging as a critical technology for enforcing Operational Design Domains (ODDs). However, existing solutions struggle to reconcile high-fidelity learning with the structural requirements of verifiable control. We address this by introducing PCARNN-DCBF, a novel pipeline integrating a Physics-encoded Control-Affine Residual Neural Network with a preview-based Discrete Control Barrier Function. Unlike generic learned models, PCARNN explicitly preserves the control-affine structure of vehicle dynamics, ensuring the linearity required for reliable optimization. This enables the DCBF to enforce polygonal keep-in constraints via a real-time Quadratic Program (QP) that handles high relative degree and mitigates actuator saturation. Experiments in CARLA across electric and combustion platforms demonstrate that this structure-preserving approach significantly outperforms analytical and unstructured neural baselines.",human
"Diffusion Policy has shown great performance in robotic manipulation tasks under stochastic perturbations, due to its ability to model multimodal action distributions. Nonetheless, its reliance on a computationally expensive reverse-time diffusion (denoising) process, for action inference, makes it challenging to use for real-time applications where quick decision-making is mandatory. This work studies the possibility of conducting the denoising process only partially before executing an action, allowing the plant to evolve according to its dynamics in parallel to the reverse-time diffusion dynamics ongoing on the computer. In a classical diffusion policy setting, the plant dynamics are usually slow and the two dynamical processes are uncoupled. Here, we investigate theoretical bounds on the stability of closed-loop systems using diffusion policies when the plant dynamics and the denoising dynamics are coupled. The contribution of this work gives a framework for faster imitation learning and a metric that yields if a controller will be stable based on the variance of the demonstrations.",human
"The introduction of large language models and other influential developments in AI-based language processing have led to an evolution in the methods available to quantitatively analyse language data. With the resultant growth of attention on language processing, significant challenges have emerged, including the lack of standardisation in organising and sharing linguistic data and the absence of standardised and reproducible processing methodologies. Striving for future standardisation, we first propose the Language Processing Data Structure (LPDS), a data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a widely adopted standard for handling neuroscience data. It provides a folder structure and file naming conventions for linguistic research. Second, we introduce pelican nlp, a modular and extensible Python package designed to enable streamlined language processing, from initial data cleaning and task-specific preprocessing to the extraction of sophisticated linguistic and acoustic features, such as semantic embeddings and prosodic metrics. The entire processing workflow can be specified within a single, shareable configuration file, which pelican nlp then executes on LPDS-formatted data. Depending on the specifications, the reproducible output can consist of preprocessed language data or standardised extraction of both linguistic and acoustic features and corresponding result aggregations. LPDS and pelican nlp collectively offer an end-to-end processing pipeline for linguistic data, designed to ensure methodological transparency and enhance reproducibility.",human
"We study the tradeoff between sample complexity and round complexity in on-demand sampling, where the learning algorithm adaptively samples from $k$ distributions over a limited number of rounds. In the realizable setting of Multi-Distribution Learning (MDL), we show that the optimal sample complexity of an $r$-round algorithm scales approximately as $dk^{Θ(1/r)} / ε$. For the general agnostic case, we present an algorithm that achieves near-optimal sample complexity of $\widetilde O((d + k) / ε^2)$ within $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$ rounds. Of independent interest, we introduce a new framework, Optimization via On-Demand Sampling (OODS), which abstracts the sample-adaptivity tradeoff and captures most existing MDL algorithms. We establish nearly tight bounds on the round complexity in the OODS setting. The upper bounds directly yield the $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$-round algorithm for agnostic MDL, while the lower bounds imply that achieving sub-polynomial round complexity would require fundamentally new techniques that bypass the inherent hardness of OODS.",human
"Processing-In-Memory (PIM) devices integrated with high-performance Host processors (e.g., GPUs) can accelerate memory-intensive kernels in Machine Learning (ML) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), by leveraging high memory bandwidth at PIM cores. However, Host processors and PIM cores require different data layouts: Hosts need consecutive elements distributed across DRAM banks, while PIM cores need them within local banks. This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations. Our evaluations in various individual ML kernels demonstrate that DCC achieves up to 7.68x speedup (2.7x average) on HBM-PIM and up to 13.17x speedup (5.75x average) on AttAcc PIM backend over GPU-only execution. In end-to-end LLM inference, DCC on AttAcc accelerates GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 by up to 7.71x (4.88x average) over GPU.",human
"Imaging in low-light environments is challenging due to reduced scene radiance, which leads to elevated sensor noise and reduced color saturation. Most learning-based low-light enhancement methods rely on paired training data captured under a single low-light condition and a well-lit reference. The lack of radiance diversity limits our understanding of how enhancement techniques perform across varying illumination intensities. We introduce the Multi-Illumination Low-Light (MILL) dataset, containing images captured at diverse light intensities under controlled conditions with fixed camera settings and precise illuminance measurements. MILL enables comprehensive evaluation of enhancement algorithms across variable lighting conditions. We benchmark several state-of-the-art methods and reveal significant performance variations across intensity levels. Leveraging the unique multi-illumination structure of our dataset, we propose improvements that enhance robustness across diverse illumination scenarios. Our modifications achieve up to 10 dB PSNR improvement for DSLR and 2 dB for the smartphone on Full HD images.",human
"Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.   We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to ""consider the right questions"" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.",human
"Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) parameterize continuous signals via multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enabling compact, resolution-independent modeling for tasks like image, audio, and 3D reconstruction. However, fitting high-resolution signals demands optimizing over millions of coordinates, incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address it, we propose NTK-Guided Implicit Neural Teaching (NINT), which accelerates training by dynamically selecting coordinates that maximize global functional updates. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), NINT scores examples by the norm of their NTK-augmented loss gradients, capturing both fitting errors and heterogeneous leverage (self-influence and cross-coordinate coupling). This dual consideration enables faster convergence compared to existing methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NINT significantly reduces training time by nearly half while maintaining or improving representation quality, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.",human
"This work proposes a hybrid deep learning approach, namely Residual and Spatial Learning based Channel Augmented Integrated CNN-Transformer architecture, that leverages the strengths of CNN and Transformer towards enhanced MPox detection. The proposed RS-CA-HSICT framework is composed of an HSICT block, a residual CNN module, a spatial CNN block, and a CA, which enhances the diverse feature space, detailed lesion information, and long-range dependencies. The new HSICT module first integrates an abstract representation of the stem CNN and customized ICT blocks for efficient multihead attention and structured CNN layers with homogeneous (H) and structural (S) operations. The customized ICT blocks learn global contextual interactions and local texture extraction. Additionally, H and S layers learn spatial homogeneity and fine structural details by reducing noise and modeling complex morphological variations. Moreover, inverse residual learning enhances vanishing gradient, and stage-wise resolution reduction ensures scale invariance. Furthermore, the RS-CA-HSICT framework augments the learned HSICT channels with the TL-driven Residual and Spatial CNN maps for enhanced multiscale feature space capturing global and localized structural cues, subtle texture, and contrast variations. These channels, preceding augmentation, are refined through the Channel-Fusion-and-Attention block, which preserves discriminative channels while suppressing redundant ones, thereby enabling efficient computation. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism refines pixel selection to detect subtle patterns and intra-class contrast variations in Mpox. Experimental results on both the Kaggle benchmark and a diverse MPox dataset reported classification accuracy as high as 98.30% and an F1-score of 98.13%, which outperforms the existing CNNs and ViTs.",human
"Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.",human
"Peer review is a cornerstone of scientific publishing, including at premier machine learning conferences such as ICLR. As submission volumes increase, understanding the nature and dynamics of the review process is crucial for improving its efficiency, effectiveness, and the quality of published papers. We present a large-scale analysis of the ICLR 2024 and 2025 peer review processes, focusing on before- and after-rebuttal scores and reviewer-author interactions. We examine review scores, author-reviewer engagement, temporal patterns in review submissions, and co-reviewer influence effects. Combining quantitative analyses with LLM-based categorization of review texts and rebuttal discussions, we identify common strengths and weaknesses for each rating group, as well as trends in rebuttal strategies that are most strongly associated with score changes. Our findings show that initial scores and the ratings of co-reviewers are the strongest predictors of score changes during the rebuttal, pointing to a degree of reviewer influence. Rebuttals play a valuable role in improving outcomes for borderline papers, where thoughtful author responses can meaningfully shift reviewer perspectives. More broadly, our study offers evidence-based insights to improve the peer review process, guiding authors on effective rebuttal strategies and helping the community design fairer and more efficient review processes. Our code and score changes data are available at https://github.com/papercopilot/iclr-insights.",human
"As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) develops, understanding user intent behind DeFi transactions is crucial yet challenging due to complex smart contract interactions, multifaceted on-/off-chain factors, and opaque hex logs. Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability. Experiments show that TIM significantly outperforms machine learning models, single LLMs, and single Agent baselines. We also analyze core challenges in intent inference. This work helps provide a more reliable understanding of user motivations in DeFi, offering context-aware explanations for complex blockchain activity.",human
"Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. However, balancing energy efficiency and fair participation while ensuring high model accuracy remains challenging in wireless edge systems due to heterogeneous resources, unequal client contributions, and limited communication capacity. To address these challenges, we propose FairEnergy, a fairness-aware energy minimization framework that integrates a contribution score capturing both the magnitude of updates and their compression ratio into the joint optimization of device selection, bandwidth allocation, and compression level. The resulting mixed-integer non-convex problem is solved by relaxing binary selection variables and applying Lagrangian decomposition to handle global bandwidth coupling, followed by per-device subproblem optimization. Experiments on non-IID data show that FairEnergy achieves higher accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 79\% compared to baseline strategies.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping organizational knowing by unsettling the epistemological foundations of representational and practice-based perspectives. We conceptualize LLMs as Haraway-ian monsters, that is, hybrid, boundary-crossing entities that destabilize established categories while opening new possibilities for inquiry. Focusing on analogizing as a fundamental driver of knowledge, we examine how LLMs generate connections through large-scale statistical inference. Analyzing their operation across the dimensions of surface/deep analogies and near/far domains, we highlight both their capacity to expand organizational knowing and the epistemic risks they introduce. Building on this, we identify three challenges of living with such epistemic monsters: the transformation of inquiry, the growing need for dialogical vetting, and the redistribution of agency. By foregrounding the entangled dynamics of knowing-with-LLMs, the paper extends organizational theory beyond human-centered epistemologies and invites renewed attention to how knowledge is created, validated, and acted upon in the age of intelligent technologies.",human
"This paper introduces a classification method using in-context learning in time-series foundation models (TSFM). We show how data, which was not part of the TSFM training data corpus, can be classified without the need of finetuning the model. Examples are represented in the form of targets (class id) and covariates (data matrix) within the prompt of the model, which enables to classify an unknown covariate data pattern alongside the forecast axis through in-context learning. We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels. Leveraging the scalability of pre-trained models this method demonstrates efficacy across varied operational conditions. This marks significant progress beyond custom narrow AI solutions towards broader, AI-driven maintenance systems.",human
"The Gini score is a popular tool in statistical modeling and machine learning for model validation and model selection. It is a purely rank based score that allows one to assess risk rankings. The Gini score for statistical modeling has mainly been used in a binary context, in which it has many equivalent reformulations such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) or the area under the curve (AUC). In the actuarial literature, this rank based score for binary responses has been extended to general real-valued random variables using Lorenz curves and concentration curves. While these initial concepts assume that the risk ranking is generated by a continuous distribution function, we discuss in this paper how the Gini score can be used in the case of ties in the risk ranking. Moreover, we adapt the Gini score to the common actuarial situation of having case weights.",human
"Accurately simulating wave propagation is crucial in fields such as acoustics, electromagnetism, and seismic analysis. Traditional numerical methods, like finite difference and finite element approaches, are widely used to solve governing partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the Helmholtz equation. However, these methods face significant computational challenges when applied to high-frequency wave problems in complex two-dimensional domains. This work investigates Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs) and their multilevel extensions as a promising alternative. These methods leverage domain decomposition, partitioning the computational domain into overlapping sub-domains, each governed by a local neural network. We assess their accuracy and computational efficiency in solving the Helmholtz equation for the homogeneous case, demonstrating their potential to mitigate the limitations of traditional approaches.",human
"Dense retrieval has become a foundational paradigm in modern search systems, especially on short-video platforms. However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision. This paradigm inevitably leads to a filter bubble effect, where potentially relevant but previously unseen content is excluded from the training signal, biasing the model toward narrow and conservative retrieval. In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level). To effectively utilize these heterogeneous signals, we introduce a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and a corresponding H-InfoNCE loss that together enable fine-grained, relevance-aware optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on Kuaishou Search, a large-scale commercial short-video search platform, demonstrate that CroPS significantly outperforms strong baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates. CroPS is now fully deployed in Kuaishou Search, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.",human
"Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.",human
"Phishing websites pose a major cybersecurity threat, exploiting unsuspecting users and causing significant financial and organisational harm. Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services. By presenting a comparative analysis of costs and benefits, this work lays the foundation for future research on the adaptation, fine-tuning, and deployment of SLMs in phishing detection systems, aiming to balance security effectiveness and economic practicality.",human
"Despite the architectural similarities between tabular in-context learning (ICL) models and large language models (LLMs), little is known about how individual layers contribute to tabular prediction. In this paper, we investigate how the latent spaces evolve across layers in tabular ICL models, identify potential redundant layers, and compare these dynamics with those observed in LLMs. We analyze TabPFN and TabICL through the ""layers as painters"" perspective, finding that only subsets of layers share a common representational language, suggesting structural redundancy and offering opportunities for model compression and improved interpretability.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping unsupervised learning by offering an unprecedented ability to perform text clustering based on their deep semantic understanding. However, their direct application is fundamentally limited by a lack of stateful memory for iterative refinement and the difficulty of managing cluster granularity. As a result, existing methods often rely on complex pipelines with external modules, sacrificing a truly end-to-end approach. We introduce LLM-MemCluster, a novel framework that reconceptualizes clustering as a fully LLM-native task. It leverages a Dynamic Memory to instill state awareness and a Dual-Prompt Strategy to enable the model to reason about and determine the number of clusters. Evaluated on several benchmark datasets, our tuning-free framework significantly and consistently outperforms strong baselines. LLM-MemCluster presents an effective, interpretable, and truly end-to-end paradigm for LLM-based text clustering.",human
"This paper describes the systems developed by SPRING Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, for the ASRU MADASR 2.0 challenge. The systems developed focuses on adapting ASR systems to improve in predicting the language and dialect of the utterance among 8 languages across 33 dialects. We participated in Track 1 and Track 2, which restricts the use of additional data and develop from-the-scratch multilingual systems. We presented a novel training approach using Multi-Decoder architecture with phonemic Common Label Set (CLS) as intermediate representation. It improved the performance over the baseline (in the CLS space). We also discuss various methods used to retain the gain obtained in the phonemic space while converting them back to the corresponding grapheme representations. Our systems beat the baseline in 3 languages (Track 2) in terms of WER/CER and achieved the highest language ID and dialect ID accuracy among all participating teams (Track 2).",human
"We investigate the sampling-based optimal path planning problem for robotics in complex and dynamic environments. Most existing sampling-based algorithms neglect environmental information or the information from previous samples. Yet, these pieces of information are highly informative, as leveraging them can provide better heuristics when sampling the next state. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based planning algorithm, called \emph{RRT*former}, which integrates the standard RRT* algorithm with a Transformer network in a novel way. Specifically, the Transformer is used to extract features from the environment and leverage information from previous samples to better guide the sampling process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing sampling-based approaches such as RRT*, Neural RRT*, and their variants, our algorithm achieves considerable improvements in both the optimality of the path and sampling efficiency. The code for our implementation is available on https://github.com/fengmingyang666/RRTformer.",human
"In the user growth scenario, Internet companies invest heavily in paid acquisition channels to acquire new users. But sustainable growth depends on acquired users' generating lifetime value (LTV) exceeding customer acquisition cost (CAC). In order to maximize LTV/CAC ratio, it is crucial to predict channel-level LTV in an early stage for further optimization of budget allocation. The LTV forecasting problem is significantly different from traditional time series forecasting problems, and there are three main challenges. Firstly, it is an unaligned multi-time series forecasting problem that each channel has a number of LTV series of different activation dates. Secondly, to predict in the early stage, it faces the imbalanced short-input long-output (SILO) challenge. Moreover, compared with the commonly used time series datasets, the real LTV series are volatile and non-stationary, with more frequent fluctuations and higher variance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Trapezoidal Temporal Fusion (TTF) to address the above challenges. We introduce a trapezoidal multi-time series module to deal with data unalignment and SILO challenges, and output accurate predictions with a multi-tower structure called MT-FusionNet. The framework has been deployed to the online system for Douyin. Compared to the previously deployed online model, MAPEp decreased by 4.3%, and MAPEa decreased by 3.2%, where MAPEp denotes the point-wise MAPE of the LTV curve and MAPEa denotes the MAPE of the aggregated LTV.",human
"Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) offers a practical solution for model compression without requiring access to real data, making it particularly attractive in privacy-sensitive scenarios. While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.",human
"We present a class of algorithms for state estimation in nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach is based on a variational Lagrangian formulation that casts Bayesian inference as a sequence of entropic trust-region updates subject to dynamic constraints. This framework gives rise to a family of forward-backward algorithms, whose structure is determined by the chosen factorization of the variational posterior. By focusing on Gauss--Markov approximations, we derive recursive schemes with favorable computational complexity. For general nonlinear, non-Gaussian models we close the recursions using generalized statistical linear regression and Fourier--Hermite moment matching.",human
"Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.",human
"Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. We study this in a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) setting, curating 1,000+ heterogeneous games with diverse physical and causal mechanisms, and evaluate at three human-like levels: Survival, Curiosity, Utility, from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning. Our analysis reveals complementary failures: VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning.",human
"Reliable semantic segmentation is essential for clinical decision making, yet deep models rarely provide explicit statistical guarantees on their errors. We introduce a simple post-hoc framework that constructs confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. Given any pretrained segmentation model, we define a nested family of shrunken masks obtained either by increasing the score threshold or by applying morphological erosion. A labeled calibration set is used to select a single shrink parameter via conformal prediction, ensuring that, for new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data, the proportion of false positives retained in the confidence mask stays below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. The method is model-agnostic, requires no retraining, and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor. Experiments on a polyp-segmentation benchmark demonstrate target-level empirical validity. Our framework enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in settings where over-segmentation can have clinical consequences. Code at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/conseco.",human
"The brain age is a key indicator of brain health. While electroencephalography (EEG) is a practical tool for this task, existing models struggle with the common challenge of imperfect medical data, such as learning a ``normal'' baseline from weakly supervised, healthy-only cohorts. This is a critical anomaly detection task for identifying disease, but standard models are often black boxes lacking an interpretable structure. We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold. EVA-Net provides an interpretable framework for healthcare intelligence using imperfect medical data.",human
"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their reasoning and decision-making abilities when deployed as agents. Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, there still lacks systematic definition of LLM agent efficiency, hindering targeted improvements. To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/DEPO.",human
"Aircraft Maintenance Technicians (AMTs) spend up to 30% of work time searching manuals, a documented efficiency bottleneck in MRO operations where every procedure must be traceable to certified sources. We present a compliance-preserving retrieval system that adapts LLM reranking and semantic search to aviation MRO environments by operating alongside, rather than replacing, certified legacy viewers. The system constructs revision-robust embeddings from ATA chapter hierarchies and uses vision-language parsing to structure certified content, allowing technicians to preview ranked tasks and access verified procedures in existing viewers. Evaluation on 49k synthetic queries achieves >90% retrieval accuracy, while bilingual controlled studies with 10 licensed AMTs demonstrate 90.9% top-10 success rate and 95% reduction in lookup time, from 6-15 minutes to 18 seconds per task. These gains provide concrete evidence that semantic retrieval can operate within strict regulatory constraints and meaningfully reduce operational workload in real-world multilingual MRO workflows.",human
"We introduce Terra Nova, a new comprehensive challenge environment (CCE) for reinforcement learning (RL) research inspired by Civilization V. A CCE is a single environment in which multiple canonical RL challenges (e.g., partial observability, credit assignment, representation learning, enormous action spaces, etc.) arise simultaneously. Mastery therefore demands integrated, long-horizon understanding across many interacting variables. We emphasize that this definition excludes challenges that only aggregate unrelated tasks in independent, parallel streams (e.g., learning to play all Atari games at once). These aggregated multitask benchmarks primarily asses whether an agent can catalog and switch among unrelated policies rather than test an agent's ability to perform deep reasoning across many interacting challenges.",human
"Domain-specific post-training often causes catastrophic forgetting, making foundation models lose their general reasoning ability and limiting their adaptability to dynamic real-world environments. Preserving general capabilities while acquiring downstream domain knowledge is a central challenge for large language and multimodal models. Traditional continual learning methods, such as regularization, replay and architectural isolation, suffer from poor downstream performance, reliance on inaccessible historical data, or additional parameter overhead. While recent parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods can alleviate forgetting, their effectiveness strongly depends on the choice of parameters and update strategies. In this paper, we introduce PIECE, a Parameter Importance Estimation-based Continual Enhancement method that preserves general ability while efficiently learning domain knowledge without accessing prior training data or increasing model parameters. PIECE selectively updates only 0.1% of core parameters most relevant to new tasks, guided by two importance estimators: PIECE-F based on Fisher Information, and PIECE-S based on a second-order normalization that combines gradient and curvature information. Experiments across three language models and two multimodal models show that PIECE maintains general capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art continual learning performance across diverse downstream tasks. Our results highlight a practical path to scalable, domain-adaptive foundation models without catastrophic forgetting.",human
"Assessing the importance of individual features in Machine Learning is critical to understand the model's decision-making process. While numerous methods exist, the lack of a definitive ground truth for comparison highlights the need for alternative, well-founded measures. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc local feature importance method called Counterfactual Importance Distribution (CID). We generate two sets of positive and negative counterfactuals, model their distributions using Kernel Density Estimation, and rank features based on a distributional dissimilarity measure. This measure, grounded in a rigorous mathematical framework, satisfies key properties required to function as a valid metric. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by comparing with well-established local feature importance explainers. Our method not only offers complementary perspectives to existing approaches, but also improves performance on faithfulness metrics (both for comprehensiveness and sufficiency), resulting in more faithful explanations of the system. These results highlight its potential as a valuable tool for model analysis.",human

"Previous Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods for vision transformers rely on expensive retraining to recover accuracy loss in non-linear layer quantization, limiting their use in resource-constrained environments. In contrast, existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods either partially quantize non-linear functions or adjust activation distributions to maintain accuracy but fail to achieve fully integer-only inference. In this paper, we introduce IPTQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for fully integer-only vision transformers without retraining. We present approximation functions: a polynomial-based GELU optimized for vision data and a bit-shifting-based Softmax designed to improve approximation accuracy in PTQ. In addition, we propose a unified metric integrating quantization sensitivity, perturbation, and computational cost to select the optimal approximation function per activation layer. IPTQ-ViT outperforms previous PTQ methods, achieving up to 6.44\%p (avg. 1.78\%p) top-1 accuracy improvement for image classification, 1.0 mAP for object detection. IPTQ-ViT outperforms partial floating-point PTQ methods under W8A8 and W4A8, and achieves accuracy and latency comparable to integer-only QAT methods. We plan to release our code https://github.com/gihwan-kim/IPTQ-ViT.git.",human
"Objective: Machine learning (ML) predictive models are often developed without considering downstream value trade-offs and clinical interpretability. This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.",human
"We introduce HEAD-QA v2, an expanded and updated version of a Spanish/English healthcare multiple-choice reasoning dataset originally released by Vilares and Gómez-Rodríguez (2019). The update responds to the growing need for high-quality datasets that capture the linguistic and conceptual complexity of healthcare reasoning. We extend the dataset to over 12,000 questions from ten years of Spanish professional exams, benchmark several open-source LLMs using prompting, RAG, and probability-based answer selection, and provide additional multilingual versions to support future work. Results indicate that performance is mainly driven by model scale and intrinsic reasoning ability, with complex inference strategies obtaining limited gains. Together, these results establish HEAD-QA v2 as a reliable resource for advancing research on biomedical reasoning and model improvement.",human
"Existing multimodal reasoning models and frameworks suffer from fundamental architectural limitations: most lack the human-like ability to autonomously explore diverse reasoning pathways-whether in direct inference, tool-driven visual exploration, programmatic visual manipulation, or intrinsic visual imagination. Consequently, they struggle to adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks. Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state. Experimental results show that Octopus achieves the best performance on the vast majority of tasks in Octopus-Bench, highlighting the crucial role of capability coordination in agentic multimodal reasoning.",human
"Ensembling is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of machine learning models, with methods like stacking achieving strong results in tabular tasks. In time series forecasting, however, ensemble methods remain underutilized, with simple linear combinations still considered state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically explore ensembling strategies for time series forecasting. We evaluate 33 ensemble models -- both existing and novel -- across 50 real-world datasets. Our results show that stacking consistently improves accuracy, though no single stacker performs best across all tasks. To address this, we propose a multi-layer stacking framework for time series forecasting, an approach that combines the strengths of different stacker models. We demonstrate that this method consistently provides superior accuracy across diverse forecasting scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of stacking-based methods to improve AutoML systems for time series forecasting.",human
"Developing reliable UAV navigation systems requires robust air-to-air object detectors capable of distinguishing between objects seen during training and previously unseen objects. While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments confirm that our method surpasses threshold-based baselines in two-class classification by an average of 2.7% AUROC, while retaining or improving open-set mAP. Furthermore, our study uniquely enables robust three-class classification, a critical capability for safe UAV navigation, where OOD objects must be actively avoided and background regions safely ignored. Comparative analysis highlights that our method surpasses competitive techniques in AUROC across datasets, while improving closed-set mAP by up to 9 points, an 18% relative gain.",human
"Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) requires not only technological innovation but also a deeper understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing energy access and carbon emissions. While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges. This approach aims to support a shift from siloed modeling to reflexive, modular systems designed for dynamic, context-aware climate action.",human
"Automotive telemetry data exhibits slow drifts and fast spikes, often within the same sequence, making reliable anomaly detection challenging. Standard reconstruction-based methods, including sequence variational autoencoders (VAEs), use a single latent process and therefore mix heterogeneous time scales, which can smooth out spikes or inflate variances and weaken anomaly separation.   In this paper, we present STREAM-VAE, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in automotive telemetry time-series data. Our model uses a dual-path encoder to separate slow drift and fast spike signal dynamics, and a decoder that represents transient deviations separately from the normal operating pattern. STREAM-VAE is designed for deployment, producing stable anomaly scores across operating modes for both in-vehicle monitors and backend fleet analytics.   Experiments on an automotive telemetry dataset and the public SMD benchmark show that explicitly separating drift and spike dynamics improves robustness compared to strong forecasting, attention, graph, and VAE baselines.",human
"In high-dimensional statistics, the Lasso is a cornerstone method for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation. However, its reliance on the squared loss function renders it highly sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed noise, potentially leading to unreliable model selection and biased estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce the Exponential Lasso, a novel robust method that integrates an exponential-type loss function within the Lasso framework. This loss function is designed to achieve a smooth trade-off between statistical efficiency under Gaussian noise and robustness against data contamination. Unlike other methods that cap the influence of large residuals, the exponential loss smoothly redescends, effectively downweighting the impact of extreme outliers while preserving near-quadratic behavior for small errors. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the Exponential Lasso achieves strong statistical convergence rates, matching the classical Lasso under ideal conditions while maintaining its robustness in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination. Computationally, the estimator is optimized efficiently via a Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm that iteratively solves a series of weighted Lasso subproblems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive, outperforming the classical Lasso in contaminated settings and maintaining strong performance even under Gaussian noise.   Our method is implemented in the \texttt{R} package \texttt{heavylasso} available on Github: https://github.com/tienmt/heavylasso",human
"Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from two critical limitations: poor performance on ""heterophilic"" graphs and performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters (e.g., ChebyNet). While adaptive polynomial filters, such as the discrete MeixnerNet, have emerged as a potential unified solution, their extension to the continuous domain and stability with unbounded coefficients remain open questions. In this work, we propose `LaguerreNet`, a novel GNN filter based on continuous Laguerre polynomials. `LaguerreNet` learns the filter's spectral shape by making its core alpha parameter trainable, thereby advancing the adaptive polynomial approach. We solve the severe O(k^2) numerical instability of these unbounded polynomials using a `LayerNorm`-based stabilization technique. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach is highly effective: 1) `LaguerreNet` achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging heterophilic benchmarks. 2) It is exceptionally robust to over-smoothing, with performance peaking at K=10, an order of magnitude beyond where ChebyNet collapses.",human
"Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on polynomial filters, such as ChebyNet, suffer from two critical limitations: 1) performance collapse on ""heterophilic"" graphs and 2) performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters. In this work, we propose `KrawtchoukNet`, a GNN filter based on the discrete Krawtchouk polynomials. We demonstrate that `KrawtchoukNet` provides a unified solution to both problems through two key design choices. First, by fixing the polynomial's domain N to a small constant (e.g., N=20), we create the first GNN filter whose recurrence coefficients are \textit{inherently bounded}, making it exceptionally robust to over-smoothing (achieving SOTA results at K=10). Second, by making the filter's shape parameter p learnable, the filter adapts its spectral response to the graph data. We show this adaptive nature allows `KrawtchoukNet` to achieve SOTA performance on challenging heterophilic benchmarks (Texas, Cornell), decisively outperforming standard GNNs like GAT and APPNP.",human
"Time-series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently emerged as a universal paradigm for learning across diverse temporal domains. However, despite their empirical success, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent fundamental time-series concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of concept interpretability in TSFMs. Specifically, we examine: (i) which layers encode which concepts, (ii) whether concept parameters are linearly recoverable, (iii) how representations evolve in terms of concept disentanglement and abstraction across model depth, and (iv) how models process compositions of concepts. We systematically probe these questions using layer-wise analyses, linear recoverability tests, and representation similarity measures, providing a structured account of TSFM semantics. The resulting insights show that early layers mainly capture local, time-domain patterns (e.g., AR(1), level shifts, trends), while deeper layers encode dispersion and change-time signals, with spectral and warping factors remaining the hardest to recover linearly. In compositional settings, however, probe performance degrades, revealing interference between concepts. This highlights that while atomic concepts are reliably localized, composition remains a challenge, underscoring a key limitation in current TSFMs' ability to represent interacting temporal phenomena.",human
"Hardware synthesis from high-level descriptions remains fundamentally limited by the sequential optimization of interdependent design decisions. Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices.   We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph. We provide both exact MILP solving and an efficient ASAP heuristic for scalable synthesis. Our evaluation on benchmarks from diverse applications targeting Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs demonstrates that SkyEgg achieves an average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.",human
"Bayesian Optimization is critically vulnerable to extreme outliers. Existing provably robust methods typically assume a bounded cumulative corruption budget, which makes them defenseless against even a single corruption of sufficient magnitude. To address this, we introduce a new adversary whose budget is only bounded in the frequency of corruptions, not in their magnitude. We then derive RCGP-UCB, an algorithm coupling the famous upper confidence bound (UCB) approach with a Robust Conjugate Gaussian Process (RCGP). We present stable and adaptive versions of RCGP-UCB, and prove that they achieve sublinear regret in the presence of up to $O(T^{1/2})$ and $O(T^{1/3})$ corruptions with possibly infinite magnitude. This robustness comes at near zero cost: without outliers, RCGP-UCB's regret bounds match those of the standard GP-UCB algorithm.",human
"We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for Large Language Models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.",human
"Specialized edge accelerators rely on low-bit quantization, but vendor compilers differ in scaling, clipping, and kernel support, often as black boxes. The same floating-point (FP) checkpoint can therefore yield inconsistent accuracy across backends, forcing practitioners to tweak flags or refactor models to vendor-friendly operator subsets. We introduce Quant-Trim, a training-phase method that produces a hardware-neutral checkpoint robust to backend and precision choices. It combines progressive fake quantization to align training with the deployed integer grid and reverse pruning to tame outlier-driven scale inflation while preserving learnability. Quant-Trim is agnostic to quantization schemes (symmetric/asymmetric, per-tensor/per-channel, INT8/INT4) and requires no vendor-specific graph changes. Across models and tasks, it narrows the FP-to-low-bit gap, reduces dependence on compiler heuristics/calibration, and avoids per-backend retraining. We report accuracy and edge metrics latency, throughput, energy per inference, and cost under static/dynamic activation scaling and varying operator coverage.",human
"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have become widely used for enhancing large language model capabilities, but they introduce significant security vulnerabilities through prompt injection attacks. We present a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating prompt injection risks in RAG-enabled AI agents and propose a multi-layered defense framework. Our benchmark includes 847 adversarial test cases across five attack categories: direct injection, context manipulation, instruction override, data exfiltration, and cross-context contamination. We evaluate three defense mechanisms: content filtering with embedding-based anomaly detection, hierarchical system prompt guardrails, and multi-stage response verification, across seven state-of-the-art language models. Our combined framework reduces successful attack rates from 73.2% to 8.7% while maintaining 94.3% of baseline task performance. We release our benchmark dataset and defense implementation to support future research in AI agent security.",human
"Sentiment analysis of Arabic dialects presents significant challenges due to linguistic diversity and the scarcity of annotated data. This paper describes our approach to the AHaSIS shared task, which focuses on sentiment analysis on Arabic dialects in the hospitality domain. The dataset comprises hotel reviews written in Moroccan and Saudi dialects, and the objective is to classify the reviewers sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. We employed the SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning) framework, a data-efficient few-shot learning technique. On the official evaluation set, our system achieved an F1 of 73%, ranking 12th among 26 participants. This work highlights the potential of few-shot learning to address data scarcity in processing nuanced dialectal Arabic text within specialized domains like hotel reviews.",human
"Path planning in dynamic environments is a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation and robotics, where obstacles and conditions change over time, introducing uncertainty and requiring continuous adaptation. While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process. Unlike prior work, we evaluate our methods in more realistic settings, where multiple simultaneous obstacle changes and increasing difficulty levels are present. Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability. Although initial training remains time-consuming in large environments, our decentralized framework eliminates the need for a global planner and lays the groundwork for future improvements using deep RL and flexible environment decomposition.",human
"In this paper, we argue that current AI research operates on a spectrum between two different underlying conceptions of intelligence: Intelligence Realism, which holds that intelligence represents a single, universal capacity measurable across all systems, and Intelligence Pluralism, which views intelligence as diverse, context-dependent capacities that cannot be reduced to a single universal measure. Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations. Regarding AI risk, they generate categorically different assessments: realists view superintelligence as the primary risk and search for unified alignment solutions, while pluralists see diverse threats across different domains requiring context-specific solutions. We argue that making explicit these underlying assumptions can contribute to a clearer understanding of disagreements in AI research.",human
"Modern artificial intelligence systems depend heavily on large datasets for both training and transferring knowledge between models. Knowledge distillation, transfer learning, and dataset distillation have made such transfers more efficient, yet they remain fundamentally data-driven: a teacher must produce examples, logits, or gradients for a student to learn. In this work, we introduce Model-to-Model Knowledge Transmission (M2KT), a novel paradigm for data-free conceptual transfer between neural networks. M2KT enables models to exchange knowledge packets that encapsulate structured concept embeddings, abstraction graphs, reasoning traces, and provenance metadata. Unlike classical distillation, M2KT operates primarily in concept space rather than example space, and it does not require labeled datasets or teacher-generated outputs during transfer. We formalize the notion of concept manifolds, introduce an inter-model alignment mapping between teacher and student latent spaces, and derive a composite loss that enforces geometric, structural, and reasoning consistency together with explicit safety constraints. We further present algorithmic procedures for teacher-side packet generation and student-side ingestion and verification. Experiments on symbolic reasoning with large language models show that M2KT can achieve approximately 85 to 90 percent of teacher performance while reducing data usage by over 98 percent compared to standard knowledge distillation. This work establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for data-free AI-to-AI knowledge transfer and self-improving model ecosystems.",human
"Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) adjusts models using unlabeled test data to handle dynamic distribution shifts. However, existing methods rely on frequent adaptation and high computational cost, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. To address this, we propose SNAP, a sparse TTA framework that reduces adaptation frequency and data usage while preserving accuracy. SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates. Our method introduces two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which identifies and stores a small set of samples that are representative of both class and domain characteristics to support efficient adaptation with limited data; and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which dynamically adjusts normalization statistics at inference time by leveraging these representative samples, enabling efficient alignment to shifting target domains. Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%. This demonstrates its strong potential for practical use on edge devices serving latency-sensitive applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/chahh9808/SNAP.",human
"This paper compares two distinct approaches to modeling robotic behavior: imperative Behavior Trees (BTs) and declarative Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework. BTs structure behavior hierarchically using control-flow, whereas EO represents the domain as a temporal, event-based semantic graph driven by dataflow rules. We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios. The comparison is grounded in a practical mobile manipulation task. This comparison highlights the respective operational strengths of each approach in dynamic, evolving robotic systems.",human
"Object detection with 3D radar is essential for 360-degree automotive perception, but radar's long wavelengths produce sparse and irregular reflections that challenge traditional grid and sequence-based convolutional and transformer detectors. This paper introduces Graph Query Networks (GQN), an attention-based framework that models objects sensed by radar as graphs, to extract individualized relational and contextual features. GQN employs a novel concept of graph queries to dynamically attend over the bird's-eye view (BEV) space, constructing object-specific graphs processed by two novel modules: EdgeFocus for relational reasoning and DeepContext Pooling for contextual aggregation. On the NuScenes dataset, GQN improves relative mAP by up to +53%, including a +8.2% gain over the strongest prior radar method, while reducing peak graph construction overhead by 80% with moderate FLOPs cost.",human
"Chart editing reduces manual effort in visualization design. Typical benchmarks limited in data diversity and assume access to complete chart code, which is seldom in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we present ChartEditVista, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7,964 samples spanning 31 chart categories. It encompasses diverse editing instructions and covers nearly all editable chart elements. The inputs in ChartEditVista include only the original chart image and natural language editing instructions, without the original chart codes. ChartEditVista is generated through a fully automated pipeline that produces, edits, and verifies charts, ensuring high-quality chart editing data. Besides, we introduce two novel fine-grained, rule-based evaluation metrics: the layout metric, which evaluates the position, size and color of graphical components; and the text metric, which jointly assesses textual content and font styling. Building on top of ChartEditVista, we present ChartEditor, a model trained using a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a novel rendering reward to simultaneously enforce code executability and visual fidelity. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we demonstrate that ChartEditVista provides a robust evaluation, while ChartEditor consistently outperforms models with similar-scale and larger-scale on chart editing tasks.",human
"We investigate the use of Reinforcement Learning for the optimal execution of meta-orders, where the objective is to execute incrementally large orders while minimizing implementation shortfall and market impact over an extended period of time. Departing from traditional parametric approaches to price dynamics and impact modeling, we adopt a model-free, data-driven framework. Since policy optimization requires counterfactual feedback that historical data cannot provide, we employ the Queue-Reactive Model to generate realistic and tractable limit order book simulations that encompass transient price impact, and nonlinear and dynamic order flow responses. Methodologically, we train a Double Deep Q-Network agent on a state space comprising time, inventory, price, and depth variables, and evaluate its performance against established benchmarks. Numerical simulation results show that the agent learns a policy that is both strategic and tactical, adapting effectively to order book conditions and outperforming standard approaches across multiple training configurations. These findings provide strong evidence that model-free Reinforcement Learning can yield adaptive and robust solutions to the optimal execution problem.",human

"AI research is increasingly moving toward complex problem solving, where models are optimized not only for pattern recognition but for multi-step reasoning. Historically, computing's global energy footprint has been stabilized by sustained efficiency gains and natural saturation thresholds in demand. But as efficiency improvements are approaching physical limits, emerging reasoning AI lacks comparable saturation points: performance is no longer limited by the amount of available training data but continues to scale with exponential compute investments in both training and inference. This paper argues that efficiency alone will not lead to sustainable reasoning AI and discusses research and policy directions to embed explicit limits into the optimization and governance of such systems.",human
"Complex software-driven systems often interleave distributed, concurrent computation processes with physical interactions with the environment. Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.",human
"The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), has proved its effectiveness in practical applications such as DeepSeek-R1. It raises a question whether GRPO can be generalized to representation learning models. In this paper, we propose Group Relative Policy Optimization for Representation Model (GRPO-RM), and investigate the performance of GRPO-like policy in post-training representation models. Specifically, our method establishes a predefined output set to functionally replace token sequence sampling in LLMs, thereby generating an output group, which is essential for the probability-driven optimization of GRPO. In addition, a specialized reward function is designed to accommodate the properties of representation models. Extensive experiments are conducted on various real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",human
"Effective presentation skills are essential in education, professional communication, and public speaking, yet learners often lack access to high-quality exemplars or personalized coaching. Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback. Implemented on a robust backend with multi-model integration, voice cloning, and error handling mechanisms, the system demonstrates how AI-driven agents can provide engaging, human-centered, and scalable support for presentation skill development in both educational and professional contexts.",human
"Network tomography aims to infer hidden network states, such as link performance, traffic load, and topology, from external observations. Most existing methods solve these problems separately and depend on limited task-specific signals, which limits generalization and interpretability. We present PLATONT, a unified framework that models different network indicators (e.g., delay, loss, bandwidth) as projections of a shared latent network state. Guided by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, PLATONT learns this latent state through multimodal alignment and contrastive learning. By training multiple tomography tasks within a shared latent space, it builds compact and structured representations that improve cross-task generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that PLATONT consistently outperforms existing methods in link estimation, topology inference, and traffic prediction, achieving higher accuracy and stronger robustness under varying network conditions.",human
"With the global energy transition and rapid development of renewable energy, the scheduling optimization challenge for combined power-heat systems under new energy integration and multiple uncertainties has become increasingly prominent. Addressing this challenge, this study proposes an intelligent scheduling method based on the improved Dual-Delay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PVTD3) algorithm. System optimization is achieved by introducing a penalty term for grid power purchase variations. Simulation results demonstrate that under three typical scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30% renewable penetration), the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the system's comprehensive cost by 6.93%, 12.68%, and 13.59% respectively compared to the traditional TD3 algorithm. Concurrently, it reduces the average fluctuation amplitude of grid power purchases by 12.8%. Regarding energy storage management, the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the end-time state values of low-temperature thermal storage tanks by 7.67-17.67 units while maintaining high-temperature tanks within the 3.59-4.25 safety operating range. Multi-scenario comparative validation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm not only excels in economic efficiency and grid stability but also exhibits superior sustainable scheduling capabilities in energy storage device management.",human
"Long-term training of large language models (LLMs) requires maintaining stable exploration to prevent the model from collapsing into sub-optimal behaviors. Entropy is crucial in this context, as it controls exploration and helps avoid premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to maintain an appropriate level of entropy, as the training process involves a mix of positive and negative samples, each affecting entropy in different ways across steps. To address this, we propose Entropy stablilization via Proportional-Integral Control (EntroPIC), a novel method that adaptively adjusts the influence of positive and negative samples by dynamically tuning their loss coefficients. This approach stabilizes entropy throughout training, ensuring efficient exploration and steady progress. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis for both on-policy and off-policy learning settings, demonstrating that EntroPIC is effective at controlling entropy in large-scale LLM training.

We present a fully quantum Graph Neural Network (QGNN) that implements message passing via Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Our Quantum Graph Convolutional Layers (QGCLs) encode features into quantum states, process graphs with NISQ-compatible unitaries, and retrieve embeddings through measurement. Applied to D2D power control for SINR maximization, our QGNN matches classical performance with fewer parameters and inherent parallelism. This end-to-end PQC-based GNN marks a step toward quantum-accelerated wireless optimization.",human
"Million-level token inputs in long-context tasks pose significant computational and memory challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields. Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at https://github.com/liufanfanlff/C3-Context-Cascade-Compression",human
"As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, storing and transmitting them on edge devices becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional methods like quantization and pruning struggle to achieve extreme compression of LLMs without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we introduce PocketLLM, a novel approach to compress LLMs in a latent space via meta-networks. A simple encoder network is proposed to project the weights of LLMs into discrete latent vectors, which are then represented using a compact codebook. A lightweight decoder network is employed to map the codebook's representative vectors back to the original weight space. This method allows for significant compression of the large weights in LLMs, consisting solely of a small decoder, a concise codebook, and an index. Extensive experiments show that PocketLLM achieves superior performance even at significantly high compression ratios, e.g., compressing Llama 2-7B by 10x with a negligible drop in accuracy.",human
"Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful tools for predicting material properties with near first-principles accuracy and vastly reduced computational cost. However, the performance of ML models critically depends on the quality, size, and diversity of the training dataset. In materials science, this dependence is particularly important for learning from low-symmetry atomistic configurations that capture thermal excitations, structural defects, and chemical disorder, features that are ubiquitous in real materials but underrepresented in most datasets. The absence of systematic strategies for generating representative training data may therefore limit the predictive power of ML models in technologically critical fields such as energy conversion and photonics. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of graph neural network (GNN) models trained on two fundamentally different types of datasets: one composed of randomly generated atomic configurations and another constructed using physically informed sampling based on lattice vibrations. As a case study, we address the challenging task of predicting electronic and mechanical properties of a prototypical family of optoelectronic materials under realistic finite-temperature conditions. We find that the phonons-informed model consistently outperforms the randomly trained counterpart, despite relying on fewer data points. Explainability analyses further reveal that high-performing models assign greater weight to chemically meaningful bonds that control property variations, underscoring the importance of physically guided data generation. Overall, this work demonstrates that larger datasets do not necessarily yield better GNN predictive models and introduces a simple and general strategy for efficiently constructing high-quality training data in materials informatics.",human
"With the rapid expansion of unstructured clinical texts in electronic health records (EHRs), clinical named entity recognition (NER) has become a crucial technique for extracting medical information. However, traditional supervised models such as CRF and BioClinicalBERT suffer from high annotation costs. Although zero-shot NER based on large language models (LLMs) reduces the dependency on labeled data, challenges remain in aligning example selection with task granularity and effectively integrating prompt design with self-improvement frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose OEMA, a novel zero-shot clinical NER framework based on multi-agent collaboration. OEMA consists of three core components: (1) a self-annotator that autonomously generates candidate examples; (2) a discriminator that leverages SNOMED CT to filter token-level examples by clinical relevance; and (3) a predictor that incorporates entity-type descriptions to enhance inference accuracy. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, MTSamples and VAERS, demonstrate that OEMA achieves state-of-the-art performance under exact-match evaluation. Moreover, under related-match criteria, OEMA performs comparably to the supervised BioClinicalBERT model while significantly outperforming the traditional CRF method. OEMA improves zero-shot clinical NER, achieving near-supervised performance under related-match criteria. Future work will focus on continual learning and open-domain adaptation to expand its applicability in clinical NLP.",human
"Intrinsic dimension (ID) is an important tool in modern LLM analysis, informing studies of training dynamics, scaling behavior, and dataset structure, yet its textual determinants remain underexplored. We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text ""representationally simple"" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively ""easy"", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.",human
"Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging alongside autoregressive models as a powerful paradigm for complex reasoning, with reinforcement learning increasingly used for downstream alignment. Existing trajectory-based RL methods uniformly allocate policy gradients across denoising steps, implicitly treating all steps as equally important. We challenge this assumption by analyzing trajectories with several step-level metrics: entropy-based uncertainty, Confidence-Margin (CM) uncertainty, and Rate of Entropy Change (RoEC). These reveal structured ""zones of confusion"": transient spikes in uncertainty and instability that strongly predict final success or failure, while most steps remain stable. We propose Adaptive Trajectory Policy Optimization (ATPO), a lightweight step-selection strategy that dynamically reallocates gradient updates to these high-leverage steps without changing the RL objective, rewards, or compute budget. Using a hybrid RoEC+CM rule, ATPO delivers substantial gains in reasoning accuracy and training stability across benchmarks, showing that exploiting trajectory dynamics is key to advancing dLLM RL.",human
"Current state of the art measures like BLEU, CIDEr, VQA score, SigLIP-2 and CLIPScore are often unable to capture semantic or structural accuracy, especially for domain-specific or context-dependent scenarios. For this, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Data Evaluation (PCMDE) metric combining large language models with reasoning, knowledge based mapping and vision-language models to overcome these limitations. The architecture is comprised of three main stages: (1) feature extraction of spatial and semantic information with multimodal features through object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive component-level validation; and (3) physics-guided reasoning using large language models for structural and relational constraints (e.g., alignment, position, consistency) enforcement.",human
"Pediatric pancreatitis is a progressive and debilitating inflammatory condition, including acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, that presents significant clinical diagnostic challenges. Machine learning-based methods also face diagnostic challenges due to limited sample availability and multimodal imaging complexity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Upstream Probabilistic Meta-Imputation (UPMI), a light-weight augmentation strategy that operates upstream of a meta-learner in a low-dimensional meta-feature space rather than in image space. Modality-specific logistic regressions (T1W and T2W MRI radiomics) produce probability outputs that are transformed into a 7-dimensional meta-feature vector. Class-conditional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are then fit within each cross-validation fold to sample synthetic meta-features that, combined with real meta-features, train a Random Forest (RF) meta-classifier. On 67 pediatric subjects with paired T1W/T2W MRIs, UPMI achieves a mean AUC of 0.908 $\pm$ 0.072, a $\sim$5% relative gain over a real-only baseline (AUC 0.864 $\pm$ 0.061).",human
"Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with function-calling capabilities are increasingly deployed, but remain vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks that hijack their tool calls. In response, numerous IPI-centric defense frameworks have emerged. However, these defenses are fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses. Our paper provides a foundation and critical insights for the future development of more secure and usable IPI-centric agent defense frameworks.",human
"This paper introduces SOLID (Synergizing Optimization and Large Language Models for Intelligent Decision-Making), a novel framework that integrates mathematical optimization with the contextual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). SOLID facilitates iterative collaboration between optimization and LLMs agents through dual prices and deviation penalties. This interaction improves the quality of the decisions while maintaining modularity and data privacy. The framework retains theoretical convergence guarantees under convexity assumptions, providing insight into the design of LLMs prompt. To evaluate SOLID, we applied it to a stock portfolio investment case with historical prices and financial news as inputs. Empirical results demonstrate convergence under various scenarios and indicate improved annualized returns compared to a baseline optimizer-only method, validating the synergy of the two agents. SOLID offers a promising framework for advancing automated and intelligent decision-making across diverse domains.",human
"Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) algorithms typically require tailored designs for knowledge transfer, in order to assure convergence and optimality in multitask optimization. In this paper, we explore designing a systematic and generalizable knowledge transfer policy through Reinforcement Learning. We first identify three major challenges: determining the task to transfer (where), the knowledge to be transferred (what) and the mechanism for the transfer (how). To address these challenges, we formulate a multi-role RL system where three (groups of) policy networks act as specialized agents: a task routing agent incorporates an attention-based similarity recognition module to determine source-target transfer pairs via attention scores; a knowledge control agent determines the proportion of elite solutions to transfer; and a group of strategy adaptation agents control transfer strength by dynamically controlling hyper-parameters in the underlying EMT framework. Through pre-training all network modules end-to-end over an augmented multitask problem distribution, a generalizable meta-policy is obtained. Comprehensive validation experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our method against representative baselines. Further in-depth analysis not only reveals the rationale behind our proposal but also provide insightful interpretations on what the system have learned.",human
"High-dimensional multimodal sampling problems from lattice field theory (LFT) have become important benchmarks for machine learning assisted sampling methods. We show that GPU-accelerated particle methods, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and nested sampling, provide a strong classical baseline that matches or outperforms state-of-the-art neural samplers in sample quality and wall-clock time on standard scalar field theory benchmarks, while also estimating the partition function. Using only a single data-driven covariance for tuning, these methods achieve competitive performance without problem-specific structure, raising the bar for when learned proposals justify their training cost.",human
"Robotic manipulation systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains. Yet existing multi-modal learning frameworks lack inherent guarantees of geometric consistency, struggling to handle spatial transformations such as rotations and translations. While recent works attempt to introduce equivariance through bespoke architectural modifications, these methods suffer from high implementation complexity, computational cost, and poor portability. Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space. As a model-agnostic solution, Eq.Bot aims to endow models with spatial equivariance without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Eq.Bot under both CNN-based (e.g., CLIPort) and Transformer-based (e.g., OpenVLA-OFT) architectures over existing methods on various robotic manipulation tasks, where the most significant improvement can reach 50.0%.",human
"The remarkable language ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from extensive training on vast datasets, often including copyrighted material, which raises serious concerns about unauthorized use. While Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) offer potential solutions for detecting such violations, existing approaches face critical limitations and challenges due to LLMs' inherent overconfidence, limited access to ground truth training data, and reliance on empirically determined thresholds.   We present COPYCHECK, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty signals to detect whether copyrighted content was used in LLM training sets. Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen"" (training data) and ``unseen"" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\% balanced accuracy. It further exhibits strong generalizability across architectures, maintaining high performance on GPT-J 6B. This work presents the first application of uncertainty for copyright detection in LLMs, offering practical tools for training data transparency.",human
"Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to mine students' evolving knowledge states and predict their future question-answering performance. Existing methods based on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are prone to introducing noises due to manual or random selection of meta-paths and lack necessary quality assessment of meta-path instances. Conversely, recent large language models (LLMs)-based methods ignore the rich information across students, and both paradigms struggle to deliver consistently accurate and evidence-based explanations. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports. Experiments on four public datasets show that HISE-KT outperforms existing KT baselines in both prediction performance and interpretability.",human
"Masked auto-regressive diffusion models (MAR) benefit from the expressive modeling ability of diffusion models and the flexibility of masked auto-regressive ordering. However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names. In conclusion, MARVAL demonstrates the first practical path to distillation and RL of masked auto-regressive diffusion models, enabling fast sampling and better preference alignments.",human
"Accurate brain age estimation from structural MRI is a valuable biomarker for studying aging and neurodegeneration. Traditional regression and CNN-based methods face limitations such as manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting on heterogeneous data. Pure transformer models, while effective, require large datasets and high computational cost. We propose Brain ResNet over trained Vision Transformer (BrainRotViT), a hybrid architecture that combines the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViT) with the local refinement of residual CNNs. A ViT encoder is first trained on an auxiliary age and sex classification task to learn slice-level features. The frozen encoder is then applied to all sagittal slices to generate a 2D matrix of embedding vectors, which is fed into a residual CNN regressor that incorporates subject sex at the final fully-connected layer to estimate continuous brain age. Our method achieves an MAE of 3.34 years (Pearson $r=0.98$, Spearman $ρ=0.97$, $R^2=0.95$) on validation across 11 MRI datasets encompassing more than 130 acquisition sites, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models. It also generalizes well across 4 independent cohorts with MAEs between 3.77 and 5.04 years. Analyses on the brain age gap (the difference between the predicted age and actual age) show that aging patterns are associated with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. Model attention maps highlight aging-associated regions of the brain, notably the cerebellar vermis, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobes, and medial superior frontal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that this method provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging the gap between CNN- and transformer-based approaches while opening new avenues for aging and neurodegeneration research.",human
"With nearly 1.5 billion people and more than 120 major languages, India represents one of the most diverse regions in the world. As multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, robust evaluation methodologies are essential to drive progress toward equitable AI for low-resource languages. Current multilingual VLM evaluations suffer from four major limitations: reliance on unverified auto-translations, narrow task/domain coverage, limited sample sizes, and lack of cultural and natively sourced Question-Answering (QA). To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; (2) the most comprehensive vision-language benchmark for Hindi and and Telugu, including adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native novel Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding) with approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language; and (3) a detailed performance analysis of various State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-weight and closed-source VLMs. We find a regression in performance for tasks in English versus in Indian languages for 4 out of 5 tasks across all the models, with an average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points for Telugu. We categorize common failure modes to highlight concrete areas of improvement in multilingual multimodal understanding.",human
"Efficient and sustainable maritime transport increasingly depends on reliable forecasting and adaptive routing, yet operational adoption remains difficult due to forecast latencies and the need for human judgment in rapid decision-making under changing ocean conditions. We introduce SWR-Viz, an AI-assisted visual analytics framework that combines a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator wave forecast model with SIMROUTE-based routing and interactive emissions analytics. The framework generates near-term forecasts directly from current conditions, supports data assimilation with sparse observations, and enables rapid exploration of what-if routing scenarios. We evaluate the forecast models and SWR-Viz framework along key shipping corridors in the Japan Coast and Gulf of Mexico, showing both improved forecast stability and realistic routing outcomes comparable to ground-truth reanalysis wave products. Expert feedback highlights the usability of SWR-Viz, its ability to isolate voyage segments with high emission reduction potential, and its value as a practical decision-support system. More broadly, this work illustrates how lightweight AI forecasting can be integrated with interactive visual analytics to support human-centered decision-making in complex geospatial and environmental domains.",human
"The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a fundamental NP-hard task in intelligent transportation systems with broad applications in logistics and distribution. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promise, yet classical models rely on large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are parameter-heavy and memory-bound. We propose a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) within a DRL framework, where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) replace conventional MLPs at critical readout stages. The hybrid model maintains the expressive capacity of graph attention encoders while reducing trainable parameters by more than 50%. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) with greedy and stochastic decoding, experiments on VRP benchmarks show that Q-GAT achieves faster convergence and reduces routing cost by about 5% compared with classical GAT baselines. These results demonstrate the potential of PQC-enhanced GNNs as compact and effective solvers for large-scale routing and logistics optimization.",human
"In industrial equipment monitoring, fault diagnosis is critical for ensuring system reliability and enabling predictive maintenance. However, the scarcity of fault data, due to the rarity of fault events and the high cost of data annotation, significantly hinders data-driven approaches. Existing time-series generation models, optimized for abundant normal data, struggle to capture fault distributions in few-shot scenarios, producing samples that lack authenticity and diversity due to the large domain gap and high intra-class variability of faults. To address this, we propose a novel few-shot fault time-series generation framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a positive-negative difference adapter, leveraging pre-trained normal data distributions to model the discrepancies between normal and fault domains for accurate fault synthesis. Additionally, a diversity loss is introduced to prevent mode collapse, encouraging the generation of diverse fault samples through inter-sample difference regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional methods in authenticity and diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks.",human
"The application of spectral-shifting films in greenhouses to shift green light to red light has shown variable growth responses across crop species. However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training. This study provide insight into the complex interactions between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components by improving the ability to predict solar spectral shift effects using SF.",human
"It has been discovered that latent-Euclidean variational autoencoders (VAEs) admit, in various capacities, Riemannian structure. We adapt these arguments but for complex VAEs with a complex latent stage. We show that complex VAEs reveal to some level Kähler geometric structure. Our methods will be tailored for decoder geometry. We derive the Fisher information metric in the complex case under a latent complex Gaussian regularization with trivial relation matrix. It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric Kähler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a Kähler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that has rough equivalence to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying Kähler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale. We show that we can regularize the latent space with decoder geometry, and that we can sample in accordance with a weighted complex volume element. We demonstrate these strategies, at the exchange of sample variation, yield consistently smoother representations and fewer semantic outliers.",human
"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve answer quality through explicit chain-of-thought, yet this very capability introduces new safety risks: harmful content can be subtly injected, surface gradually, or be justified by misleading rationales within the reasoning trace. Existing safety evaluations, however, primarily focus on output-level judgments and rarely capture these dynamic risks along the reasoning process. In this paper, we present SafeRBench, the first benchmark that assesses LRM safety end-to-end -- from inputs and intermediate reasoning to final outputs. (1) Input Characterization: We pioneer the incorporation of risk categories and levels into input design, explicitly accounting for affected groups and severity, and thereby establish a balanced prompt suite reflecting diverse harm gradients. (2) Fine-Grained Output Analysis: We introduce a micro-thought chunking mechanism to segment long reasoning traces into semantically coherent units, enabling fine-grained evaluation across ten safety dimensions. (3) Human Safety Alignment: We validate LLM-based evaluations against human annotations specifically designed to capture safety judgments. Evaluations on 19 LRMs demonstrate that SafeRBench enables detailed, multidimensional safety assessment, offering insights into risks and protective mechanisms from multiple perspectives.",human
"Automated web application testing is a critical component of modern software development, with frameworks like Selenium widely adopted for validating functionality through browser automation. Among the essential aspects of such testing is the ability to interact with and validate web forms, a task that requires syntactically correct, executable scripts with high coverage of input fields. Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4o and other popular LLMs, across all evaluation metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for future research on LLM-based web testing and provides resources to support ongoing progress in this area.",human
"Self-supervised depth estimation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog, where reduced visibility critically impairs depth prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-evolution contrastive learning framework called SEC-Depth for self-supervised robust depth estimation tasks. Our approach leverages intermediate parameters generated during training to construct temporally evolving latency models. Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples. This mechanism adaptively adjusts learning objectives while implicitly sensing weather degradation severity, reducing the needs for manual intervention. Experiments show that our method integrates seamlessly into diverse baseline models and significantly enhances robustness in zero-shot evaluations.",human
"The rapid proliferation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced unprecedented security challenges, particularly in phishing detection within academic environments. Academic institutions and researchers are high-value targets, facing dynamic, multilingual, and context-dependent threats that leverage research backgrounds, academic collaborations, and personal information to craft highly tailored attacks. Existing security benchmarks largely rely on datasets that do not incorporate specific academic background information, making them inadequate for capturing the evolving attack patterns and human-centric vulnerability factors specific to academia. To address this gap, we present AdapT-Bench, a unified methodological framework and benchmark suite for systematically evaluating MLLM defense capabilities against dynamic phishing attacks in academic settings.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into intelligent tutoring systems to provide human-like and adaptive instruction. However, most existing approaches fail to capture how students' knowledge evolves dynamically across their proficiencies, conceptual gaps, and forgetting patterns. This challenge is particularly acute in mathematics tutoring, where effective instruction requires fine-grained scaffolding precisely calibrated to each student's mastery level and cognitive retention. To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems.",human
"Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.",human
"High-quality intraoperative feedback from a surgical trainer is pivotal for improving trainee performance and long-term skill acquisition. Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%. Grounding generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity and yields clinician-verifiable rationales, supporting auditable use in surgical training.",human
"High-dimensional neuroimaging analyses for clinical diagnosis are often constrained by compromises in spatiotemporal fidelity and by the limited adaptability of large-scale, general-purpose models. To address these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Curriculum Learning for Spatiotemporal Encoding (DCL-SE), an end-to-end framework centered on data-driven spatiotemporal encoding (DaSE). We leverage Approximate Rank Pooling (ARP) to efficiently encode three-dimensional volumetric brain data into information-rich, two-dimensional dynamic representations, and then employ a dynamic curriculum learning strategy, guided by a Dynamic Group Mechanism (DGM), to progressively train the decoder, refining feature extraction from global anatomical structures to fine pathological details. Evaluated across six publicly available datasets, including Alzheimer's disease and brain tumor classification, cerebral artery segmentation, and brain age prediction, DCL-SE consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. These findings underscore the critical importance of compact, task-specific architectures in the era of large-scale pretrained networks.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.",human
"Conformal prediction (CP) constructs uncertainty sets for model outputs with finite-sample coverage guarantees. A candidate output is included in the prediction set if its non-conformity score is not considered extreme relative to the scores observed on a set of calibration examples. However, this procedure is only straightforward when scores are scalar-valued, which has limited CP to real-valued scores or ad-hoc reductions to one dimension. The problem of ordering vectors has been studied via optimal transport (OT), which provides a principled method for defining vector-ranks and multivariate quantile regions, though typically with only asymptotic coverage guarantees. We restore finite-sample, distribution-free coverage by conformalizing the vector-valued OT quantile region. Here, a candidate's rank is defined via a transport map computed for the calibration scores augmented with that candidate's score. This defines a continuum of OT problems for which we prove that the resulting optimal assignment is piecewise-constant across a fixed polyhedral partition of the score space. This allows us to characterize the entire prediction set tractably, and provides the machinery to address a deeper limitation of prediction sets: that they only indicate which outcomes are plausible, but not their relative likelihood. In one dimension, conformal predictive distributions (CPDs) fill this gap by producing a predictive distribution with finite-sample calibration. Extending CPDs beyond one dimension remained an open problem. We construct, to our knowledge, the first multivariate CPDs with finite-sample calibration, i.e., they define a valid multivariate distribution where any derived uncertainty region automatically has guaranteed coverage. We present both conservative and exact randomized versions, the latter resulting in a multivariate generalization of the classical Dempster-Hill procedure.",human
"Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely used as recommender systems, owing to their strong reasoning capability and their effectiveness in handling cold-start items. To better adapt LLMs for recommendation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been incorporated. Most existing RAG methods are user-based, retrieving purchase patterns of users similar to the target user and providing them to the LLM. In this work, we propose ItemRAG, an item-based RAG method for LLM-based recommendation that retrieves relevant items (rather than users) from item-item co-purchase histories. ItemRAG helps LLMs capture co-purchase patterns among items, which are beneficial for recommendations. Especially, our retrieval strategy incorporates semantically similar items to better handle cold-start items and uses co-purchase frequencies to improve the relevance of the retrieved items. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ItemRAG consistently (1) improves the zero-shot LLM-based recommender by up to 43% in Hit-Ratio-1 and (2) outperforms user-based RAG baselines under both standard and cold-start item recommendation settings.",human
"Spatial Transcriptomics enables mapping of gene expression within its native tissue context, but current platforms measure only a limited set of genes due to experimental constraints and excessive costs. To overcome this, computational models integrate Single-Cell RNA Sequencing data with Spatial Transcriptomics to predict unmeasured genes. We propose CASPER, a cross-attention based framework that predicts unmeasured gene expression in Spatial Transcriptomics by leveraging centroid-level representations from Single-Cell RNA Sequencing. We performed rigorous testing over four state-of-the-art Spatial Transcriptomics/Single-Cell RNA Sequencing dataset pairs across four existing baseline models. CASPER shows significant improvement in nine out of the twelve metrics for our experiments. This work paves the way for further work in Spatial Transcriptomics to Single-Cell RNA Sequencing modality translation. The code for CASPER is available at https://github.com/AI4Med-Lab/CASPER.",human
"Deep learning models perform best with abundant, high-quality labels, yet such conditions are rarely achievable in EEG-based emotion recognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels. Experiments on the ASCERTAIN dataset examine the efficiency and robustness of ours, highlighting its potential as a data-efficient and noise-tolerant approach for EEG-based affective decoding in brain-computer interface systems.",human
"We explore a Digital Twin-Based Approach for Smart Manufacturing to improve Sustainability, Efficiency, and Cost-Effectiveness for a steel production plant. Our system is based on a micro-service edge-compute platform that ingests real-time sensor data from the process into a digital twin over a converged network infrastructure. We implement agile machine learning-based control loops in the digital twin to optimize induction furnace heating, enhance operational quality, and reduce process waste. Key to our approach is a Deep Reinforcement learning-based agent used in our machine learning operation (MLOps) driven system to autonomously correlate the system state with its digital twin to identify correction actions that aim to optimize power settings for the plant. We present the theoretical basis, architectural details, and practical implications of our approach to reduce manufacturing waste and increase production quality. We design the system for flexibility so that our scalable event-driven architecture can be adapted to various industrial applications. With this research, we propose a pivotal step towards the transformation of traditional processes into intelligent systems, aligning with sustainability goals and emphasizing the role of MLOps in shaping the future of data-driven manufacturing.",human
"The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been significantly improved through reinforcement learning (RL). Nevertheless, LLMs still struggle to consistently verify their own reasoning traces. This raises the research question of how to enhance the self-verification ability of LLMs and whether such an ability can further improve reasoning performance. In this work, we propose GRPO-Verif, an algorithm that jointly optimizes solution generation and self-verification within a unified loss function, with an adjustable hyperparameter controlling the weight of the verification signal. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances self-verification capability while maintaining comparable performance in reasoning.",human
"Past efforts to map the Medline database have been limited to small subsets of the available data because of the exponentially increasing memory and processing demands of existing algorithms. We designed a novel algorithm for sparse matrix multiplication that allowed us to apply a self-organizing map to the entire Medline dataset, allowing for a more complete map of existing medical knowledge. The algorithm also increases the feasibility of refining the self-organizing map to account for changes in the dataset over time.",human
"Active learning reduces annotation costs in medical imaging by strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, individual acquisition strategies often exhibit inconsistent behavior across different stages of the active learning cycle. We propose Cyclical and Performance-Adaptive Multi-Strategy Active Learning (WaveFuse-AL), a novel framework that adaptively fuses multiple established acquisition strategies-BALD, BADGE, Entropy, and CoreSet throughout the learning process. WaveFuse-AL integrates cyclical (sinusoidal) temporal priors with performance-driven adaptation to dynamically adjust strategy importance over time. We evaluate WaveFuse-AL on three medical imaging benchmarks: APTOS-2019 (multi-class classification), RSNA Pneumonia Detection (binary classification), and ISIC-2018 (skin lesion segmentation). Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFuse-AL consistently outperforms both single-strategy and alternating-strategy baselines, achieving statistically significant performance improvements (on ten out of twelve metric measurements) while maximizing the utility of limited annotation budgets.",human
"We introduce CASTELLA, a human-annotated audio benchmark for the task of audio moment retrieval (AMR). Although AMR has various useful potential applications, there is still no established benchmark with real-world data. The early study of AMR trained the model with solely synthetic datasets. Moreover, the evaluation is based on annotated dataset of fewer than 100 samples. This resulted in less reliable reported performance. To ensure performance for applications in real-world environments, we present CASTELLA, a large-scale manually annotated AMR dataset. CASTELLA consists of 1,009, 213, and 640 audio recordings for train, valid, and test split, respectively, which is 24 times larger than the previous dataset. We also establish a baseline model for AMR using CASTELLA. Our experiments demonstrate that a model fine-tuned on CASTELLA after pre-training on the synthetic data outperformed a model trained solely on the synthetic data by 10.4 points in Recall1@0.7. CASTELLA is publicly available in https://h-munakata.github.io/CASTELLA-demo/.",human
"While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.",human
"Traditional Federated Multi-View Clustering assumes uniform views across clients, yet practical deployments reveal heterogeneous view completeness with prevalent incomplete, redundant, or corrupted data. While recent approaches model view heterogeneity, they neglect semantic conflicts from dynamic view combinations, failing to address dual uncertainties: view uncertainty (semantic inconsistency from arbitrary view pairings) and aggregation uncertainty (divergent client updates with imbalanced contributions). To address these, we propose a novel Enhanced Federated Deep Multi-View Clustering framework: first align local semantics, hierarchical contrastive fusion within clients resolves view uncertainty by eliminating semantic conflicts; a view adaptive drift module mitigates aggregation uncertainty through global-local prototype contrast that dynamically corrects parameter deviations; and a balanced aggregation mechanism coordinates client updates. Experimental results demonstrate that EFDMVC achieves superior robustness against heterogeneous uncertain views across multiple benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming all state-of-the-art baselines in comprehensive evaluations.",human
"Conventional radio frequency (RF) passive components modeling based on machine learning requires extensive electromagnetic (EM) simulations to cover geometric and frequency design spaces, creating computational bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce an uncertainty-aware Bayesian online learning framework for efficient parametric modeling of RF passive components, which includes: 1) a Bayesian neural network with reconfigurable heads for joint geometric-frequency domain modeling while quantifying uncertainty; 2) an adaptive sampling strategy that simultaneously optimizes training data sampling across geometric parameters and frequency domain using uncertainty guidance. Validated on three RF passive components, the framework achieves accurate modeling while using only 2.86% EM simulation time compared to traditional ML-based flow, achieving a 35 times speedup.",human
"Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",human
"In deep learning, a central issue is to understand how neural networks efficiently learn high-dimensional features. To this end, we explore the gradient descent learning of a general Gaussian Multi-index model $f(\boldsymbol{x})=g(\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{x})$ with hidden subspace $\boldsymbol{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$, which is the canonical setup to study representation learning. We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps. This work demonstrates the ability of neural networks to effectively learn hierarchical functions with respect to both sample and time efficiency.",human
"The innovation of the study is that the deep learning method and sentiment analysis are integrated in traditional business model analysis and forecasting, and the research subject is TSMC for industry trend prediction of semiconductor industry in Taiwan.

"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on code completion models offer an effective way to assess privacy risks by inferring whether a given code snippet was part of the training data. Existing black- and gray-box MIAs rely on expensive surrogate models or manually crafted heuristic rules, which limit their ability to capture the nuanced memorization patterns exhibited by over-parameterized code language models. To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with AUC gains of up to 102%. In addition, our method exhibits strong transferability across different models and datasets, underscoring its practical utility and generalizability.",human
"The AI trustworthiness crisis threatens to derail the artificial intelligence revolution, with regulatory barriers, security vulnerabilities, and accountability gaps preventing deployment in critical domains. Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity. Advanced security features include stream-level access control, real-time tamper detection, and behavioral anomaly analysis with minimal overhead. This approach directly addresses the regulatory, security, and accountability challenges preventing AI deployment in sensitive domains, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI systems at scale.",human
"Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) is a fundamental task for multimodal document understanding and a key testbed for vision language reasoning. However, most existing DocVQA datasets are limited to the page level and lack fine grained spatial grounding, constraining the interpretability and reasoning capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this gap, we introduce BBox DocVQA a large scale, bounding box grounded dataset designed to enhance spatial reasoning and evidence localization in visual documents. We further present an automated construction pipeline, Segment Judge and Generate, which integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification for quality assurance. The resulting dataset contains 3.6 K diverse documents and 32 K QA pairs, encompassing single and multi region as well as single and multi page scenarios. Each QA instance is grounded on explicit bounding boxes, enabling fine grained evaluation of spatial semantic alignment. Benchmarking multiple state of the art VLMs (e.g., GPT 5, Qwen2.5 VL, and InternVL) on BBox DocVQA reveals persistent challenges in spatial grounding and reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, fine tuning on BBox DocVQA substantially improves both bounding box localization and answer generation, validating its effectiveness for enhancing the reasoning ability of VLMs. Our dataset and code will be publicly released to advance research on interpretable and spatially grounded vision language reasoning.",human
"Time-series anomaly detection plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications, including industrial monitoring and fault diagnosis. Recently, Mamba-based state-space models have shown remarkable efficiency in long-sequence modeling. However, directly applying Mamba to anomaly detection tasks still faces challenges in capturing complex temporal patterns and nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we propose Fourier-KAN-Mamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Fourier layer, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and Mamba selective state-space model. The Fourier layer extracts multi-scale frequency features, KAN enhances nonlinear representation capability, and a temporal gating control mechanism further improves the model's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous patterns. Extensive experiments on MSL, SMAP, and SWaT datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

"Modern AI workloads, especially Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, increasingly demand low-latency, fine-grained GPU-to-GPU communication with device-side control. Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead.   NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support. The GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated backend leverages DOCA GPUNetIO for direct GPU-to-NIC communication, while the Proxy backend provides equivalent functionality via lock-free GPU-to-CPU queues over standard RDMA networks. We demonstrate GIN's practicality through integration with DeepEP, an MoE communication library. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that GIN provides device-initiated communication within NCCL's unified runtime, combining low-latency operations with NCCL's collective algorithms and production infrastructure.",human
"The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a ""flooding-pruning"" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.",human

We evaluate ProRAC on several RAC benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance across different benchmarks, domains, LLM backbones, and types of RAC tasks.",human
"Precise prognostic stratification of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its high heterogeneity. The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.",human
"Video Models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity video generation with coherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.",human
"Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying arrhythmia from electrocardiograms. However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local and global extraction and (ii) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework's performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.",human
"Genomic question answering often requires complex reasoning and integration across diverse biomedical sources. GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.   In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.   OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining. OpenBioLLM's modular multi-agent design reduces latency by 40-50% across benchmark tasks, significantly improving efficiency without compromising model capability. The results of our comprehensive evaluation highlight the potential of open-source multi-agent systems for genomic question answering.

"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen rapid advances in recent years and are now being applied to visual document understanding tasks. They are expected to process a wide range of document images across languages, including Japanese. Understanding documents from images requires models to read what are written in them. Since some Japanese documents are written vertically, support for vertical writing is essential. However, research specifically focused on vertically written Japanese text remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the reading capability of existing MLLMs on vertically written Japanese text. First, we generate a synthetic Japanese OCR dataset by rendering Japanese texts into images, and use it for both model fine-tuning and evaluation. This dataset includes Japanese text in both horizontal and vertical writing. We also create an evaluation dataset sourced from the real-world document images containing vertically written Japanese text. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that the existing MLLMs perform worse on vertically written Japanese text than on horizontally written Japanese text. Furthermore, we show that training MLLMs on our synthesized Japanese OCR dataset results in improving the performance of models that previously could not handle vertical writing. The datasets and code are publicly available https://github.com/llm-jp/eval_vertical_ja.",human
"Human-like agents have long been one of the goals in pursuing artificial intelligence. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents.

"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that caused a global pandemic in 2019. It is highly infectious and has the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity; some people with many risk factors have been known to have lengthy hospital stays or die from the disease. In this paper, we analyze patients' electronic health records (EHR) to predict the severity of their COVID-19 infection using the length of stay (LOS) as our measurement of severity. This is an imbalanced classification problem, as many people have a shorter LOS rather than a longer one. To combat this problem, we synthetically create alternate oversampled training data sets. Once we have this oversampled data, we run it through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which during training has its hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization. We select the model with the best F1 score and then evaluate it and discuss it.",human
"In the field of human-object interaction (HOI), detection and generation are two dual tasks that have traditionally been addressed separately, hindering the development of comprehensive interaction understanding. To address this, we propose UniHOI, which jointly models HOI detection and generation via a unified token space, thereby effectively promoting knowledge sharing and enhancing generalization. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric interaction-aware attention module and a unified semi-supervised learning paradigm, enabling effective bidirectional mapping between images and interaction semantics even under limited annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in both HOI detection and generation. Specifically, UniHOI improves accuracy by 4.9% on long-tailed HOI detection and boosts interaction metrics by 42.0% on open-vocabulary generation tasks.",human
"Personalizing digital applications for health behavior change is a promising route to making them more engaging and effective. This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time. However, developing such approaches requires making many design choices, whose effectiveness is difficult to predict from literature and costly to evaluate in practice. In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone. We provide recommendations for how LLM-generated samples can be useful in practice.",human
"The growing integration of generative AI in higher education is transforming how students write, learn, and engage with knowledge. As AI tools become more integrated into classrooms, there is an urgent need for pedagogical approaches that help students use them critically and reflectively. This study proposes a pedagogical design that integrates AI and peer feedback in a graduate-level academic writing activity. Over eight weeks, students developed literature review projects through multiple writing and revision stages, receiving feedback from both a custom-built AI reviewer and human peers. We examine two questions: (1) How did students interact with and incorporate AI and peer feedback during the writing process? and (2) How did they reflect on and build relationships with both human and AI reviewers? Data sources include student writing artifacts, AI and peer feedback, AI chat logs, and student reflections. Findings show that students engaged differently with each feedback source-relying on AI for rubric alignment and surface-level edits, and on peer feedback for conceptual development and disciplinary relevance. Reflections revealed evolving relationships with AI, characterized by increasing confidence, strategic use, and critical awareness of its limitations. The pedagogical design supported writing development, AI literacy, and disciplinary understanding. This study offers a scalable pedagogical model for integrating AI into writing instruction and contributes insights for system-level approaches to fostering meaningful human-AI collaboration in higher education.",human
"We study classification under extreme class imbalance where recall and calibration are both critical, for example in medical diagnosis scenarios. We propose AF-SMOTE, a mathematically motivated augmentation framework that first synthesizes minority points and then filters them by an adversarial discriminator and a boundary utility model. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the decision boundary smoothness and class-conditional densities, our filtering step monotonically improves a surrogate of F_beta (for beta >= 1) while not inflating Brier score. On MIMIC-IV proxy label prediction and canonical fraud detection benchmarks, AF-SMOTE attains higher recall and average precision than strong oversampling baselines (SMOTE, ADASYN, Borderline-SMOTE, SVM-SMOTE), and yields the best calibration. We further validate these gains across multiple additional datasets beyond MIMIC-IV. Our successful application of AF-SMOTE to a healthcare dataset using a proxy label demonstrates in a disease-agnostic way its practical value in clinical situations, where missing true positive cases in rare diseases can have severe consequences.",human
"Recent advances in generative AI for music have achieved remarkable fidelity and stylistic diversity, yet these systems often fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to the specific loss functions they use. This paper advocates for the systematic application of preference alignment techniques to music generation, addressing the fundamental gap between computational optimization and human musical appreciation. Drawing on recent breakthroughs including MusicRL's large-scale preference learning, multi-preference alignment frameworks like diffusion-based preference optimization in DiffRhythm+, and inference-time optimization techniques like Text2midi-InferAlign, we discuss how these techniques can address music's unique challenges: temporal coherence, harmonic consistency, and subjective quality assessment. We identify key research challenges including scalability to long-form compositions, reliability amongst others in preference modelling. Looking forward, we envision preference-aligned music generation enabling transformative applications in interactive composition tools and personalized music services. This work calls for sustained interdisciplinary research combining advances in machine learning, music-theory to create music AI systems that truly serve human creative and experiential needs.",human
"Precipitation nowcasting, which aims to provide high spatio-temporal resolution precipitation forecasts by leveraging current radar observations, is a core task in regional weather forecasting. Recently, the cascaded architecture has emerged as the mainstream paradigm for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting. This paradigm involves a deterministic model to predict posterior mean, followed by a probabilistic model to generate local stochasticity. However, existing methods commonly overlook the conflation of the systematic distribution shift in deterministic predictions and the local stochasticity. As a result, the distribution shift of the deterministic component contaminates the predictions of the probabilistic component, leading to inaccuracies in precipitation patterns and intensity, particularly over longer lead times. To address this issue, we introduce RectiCast, a two-stage framework that explicitly decouples the rectification of mean-field shift from the generation of local stochasticity via a dual Flow Matching model. In the first stage, a deterministic model generates the posterior mean. In the second stage, we introduce a Rectifier to explicitly learn the distribution shift and produce a rectified mean. Subsequently, a Generator focuses on modeling the local stochasticity conditioned on the rectified mean. Experiments on two radar datasets demonstrate that RectiCast achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.",human
"While intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) can use information from past students to personalize instruction, each new student is unique. Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes. Finally, we test different course structures with non-probing policies and we find that our policies are able to boost the performance of quiz and midterm structures more than we can in a finals-only structure, highlighting the benefit of having additional information.",human
"We propose a new hologram representation based on structured complex-valued 2D Gaussian primitives, which replaces per-pixel information storage and reduces the parameter search space by up to 10:1. To enable end-to-end training, we develop a differentiable rasterizer for our representation, integrated with a GPU-optimized light propagation kernel in free space. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to 2.5x lower VRAM usage and 50% faster optimization while producing higher-fidelity reconstructions than existing methods. We further introduce a conversion procedure that adapts our representation to practical hologram formats, including smooth and random phase-only holograms. Our experiments show that this procedure can effectively suppress noise artifacts observed in previous methods. By reducing the hologram parameter search space, our representation enables a more scalable hologram estimation in the next-generation computer-generated holography systems.",human
"Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale LLM capacity efficiently, but deployment on consumer GPUs is limited by the large memory footprint of inactive experts. Static post-training quantization reduces storage costs but cannot adapt to shifting activation patterns, causing accuracy loss under aggressive compression. So we present DynaExq, a runtime system that treats expert precision as a first-class, dynamically managed resource. DynaExq combines (1) a hotness-aware precision controller that continuously aligns expert bit-widths with long-term activation statistics, (2) a fully asynchronous precision-switching pipeline that overlaps promotion and demotion with MoE computation, and (3) a fragmentation-free memory pooling mechanism that supports hybrid-precision experts with deterministic allocation. Together, these components enable stable, non-blocking precision transitions under strict HBM budgets.   Across Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-80B MoE models and six representative benchmarks, DynaExq deploys large LLMs on single RTX 5090 and A6000 GPUs and improves accuracy by up to 4.03 points over static low-precision baselines. The results show that adaptive, workload-aware quantization is an effective strategy for memory-constrained MoE serving.",human
"Understanding the relationships between data points in the latent decision space derived by the deep learning system is critical to evaluating and interpreting the performance of the system on real world data. Detecting \textit{out-of-distribution} (OOD) data for deep learning systems continues to be an active research topic. We investigate the connection between latent space OOD detection and classification accuracy of the model. Using open source simulated and measured Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) datasets, we empirically demonstrate that the OOD detection cannot be used as a proxy measure for model performance. We hope to inspire additional research into the geometric properties of the latent space that may yield future insights into deep learning robustness and generalizability.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful linguistic engines but remain susceptible to hallucinations: plausible-sounding outputs that are factually incorrect or unsupported. In this work, we present a mathematically grounded framework to understand, measure, and mitigate these hallucinations. Drawing on probabilistic modeling, information theory, trigonometric signal analysis, and Bayesian uncertainty estimation, we analyze how errors compound autoregressively, propose refined uncertainty metrics, including semantic and phase-aware variants, and develop principled mitigation strategies such as contrastive decoding, retrieval-augmented grounding, factual alignment, and abstention. This unified lens connects recent advances in calibration, retrieval, and alignment to support safer and more reliable LLMs.",human
"The ionosphere is a critical component of near-Earth space, shaping GNSS accuracy, high-frequency communications, and aviation operations. For these reasons, accurate forecasting and modeling of ionospheric variability has become increasingly relevant. To address this gap, we present IonCast, a suite of deep learning models that include a GraphCast-inspired model tailored for ionospheric dynamics. IonCast leverages spatiotemporal learning to forecast global Total Electron Content (TEC), integrating diverse physical drivers and observational datasets. Validating on held-out storm-time and quiet conditions highlights improved skill compared to persistence. By unifying heterogeneous data with scalable graph-based spatiotemporal learning, IonCast demonstrates how machine learning can augment physical understanding of ionospheric variability and advance operational space weather resilience.",human
"Accurate prediction of project duration and cost remains one of the most challenging aspects of project management, particularly in resource-constrained and interdependent task networks. Traditional analytical techniques such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) rely on simplified and often static assumptions regarding task interdependencies and resource performance. This study proposes a novel resource-based predictive framework that integrates network representations of project activities with graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture structural and contextual relationships among tasks, resources, and time-cost dynamics. The model represents the project as a heterogeneous activity-resource graph in which nodes denote activities and resources, and edges encode temporal and resource dependencies.   We evaluate multiple learning paradigms, including GraphSAGE and Temporal Graph Networks, on both synthetic and benchmark project datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN framework achieves an average 23 to 31 percent reduction in mean absolute error compared to traditional regression and tree-based methods, while improving the coefficient of determination R2 from approximately 0.78 to 0.91 for large and complex project networks. Furthermore, the learned embeddings provide interpretable insights into resource bottlenecks and critical dependencies, enabling more explainable and adaptive scheduling decisions.",human
"Next-generation networks utilize the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to enable dynamic resource management, facilitated by the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models show promise in optimizing network resources, they often struggle with robustness and generalizability in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel resource management approach that enhances the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in a distributed Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework. Our method introduces an adaptive and selective SAM mechanism, where regularization is explicitly driven by temporal-difference (TD)-error variance, ensuring that only agents facing high environmental complexity are regularized. This targeted strategy reduces unnecessary overhead, improves training stability, and enhances generalization without sacrificing learning efficiency. We further incorporate a dynamic $ρ$ scheduling scheme to refine the exploration-exploitation trade-off across agents. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms conventional DRL approaches, yielding up to a $22\%$ improvement in resource allocation efficiency and ensuring superior QoS satisfaction across diverse O-RAN slices.",human
"This report introduces Kandinsky 5.0, a family of state-of-the-art foundation models for high-resolution image and 10-second video synthesis. The framework comprises three core line-up of models: Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite - a line-up of 6B parameter image generation models, Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite - a fast and lightweight 2B parameter text-to-video and image-to-video models, and Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro - 19B parameter models that achieves superior video generation quality. We provide a comprehensive review of the data curation lifecycle - including collection, processing, filtering and clustering - for the multi-stage training pipeline that involves extensive pre-training and incorporates quality-enhancement techniques such as self-supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. We also present novel architectural, training, and inference optimizations that enable Kandinsky 5.0 to achieve high generation speeds and state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, as demonstrated by human evaluation. As a large-scale, publicly available generative framework, Kandinsky 5.0 leverages the full potential of its pre-training and subsequent stages to be adapted for a wide range of generative applications. We hope that this report, together with the release of our open-source code and training checkpoints, will substantially advance the development and accessibility of high-quality generative models for the research community.",human
"Knowledge distillation (KD) methods can transfer knowledge of a parameter-heavy teacher model to a light-weight student model. The status quo for feature KD methods is to utilize loss functions based on logits (i.e., pre-softmax class scores) and intermediate layer features (i.e., latent representations). Unlike previous approaches, we propose a feature KD framework for training the student's backbone using feature-based losses exclusively (i.e., without logit-based losses such as cross entropy). Leveraging recent discoveries about the geometry of latent representations, we introduce a knowledge quality metric for identifying which teacher layers provide the most effective knowledge for distillation. Experiments on three image classification datasets with four diverse student-teacher pairs, spanning convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrate our KD method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering top-1 accuracy boosts of up to 15% over standard approaches. We publically share our code to facilitate future work at https://github.com/Thegolfingocto/KD_wo_CE.",human
"Calibration of option pricing models is routinely repeated as markets evolve, yet modern systems lack an operator for removing data from a calibrated model without full retraining. When quotes become stale, corrupted, or subject to deletion requirements, existing calibration pipelines must rebuild the entire nonlinear least-squares problem, even if only a small subset of data must be excluded. In this work, we introduce a principled framework for selective forgetting (machine unlearning) in parametric option calibration. We provide stability guarantees, perturbation bounds, and show that the proposed operators satisfy local exactness under standard regularity assumptions.",human
"As more autonomous vehicles operate on public roads, understanding real-world behavior of autonomous vehicles is critical to analyzing traffic safety, making policies, and public acceptance. This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence.",human
"Amid the growing prevalence of human -- AI interaction, large language models and other AI-based entities increasingly provide forms of companionship to human users. Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks. This analysis offers immediate suggestions for reducing risks while laying a foundation for deeper investigation of this critical but understudied topic.",human
"Benthic habitat is challenging due to the environmental complexity of the seafloor, technological limitations, and elevated operational costs, especially in under-explored regions. This generates knowledge gaps for the sustainable management of hydrobiological resources and their nexus with society. We developed ECOSAIC (Ecological Compression via Orthogonal Specialized Autoencoders for Interpretable Classification), an Artificial Intelligence framework for automatic classification of benthic habitats through interpretable latent representations using a customizable autoencoder. ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment. We also hope it provides new insights into how ecological principles can inform AI frameworks, particularly given the substantial data limitations that characterize ecological research.",human
"Transparent object perception remains a major challenge in computer vision research, as transparency confounds both depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time. Together, these contributions highlight edge-guided fusion as a robust approach capable of improving transparent object perception.",human
"This paper addresses data quality issues in multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) through systematic quality control and multi-stage transfer learning. We implement a quality control pipeline for MELD and IEMOCAP datasets that validates speaker identity, audio-text alignment, and face detection. We leverage transfer learning from speaker and face recognition, assuming that identity-discriminative embeddings capture not only stable acoustic and Facial traits but also person-specific patterns of emotional expression. We employ RecoMadeEasy(R) engines for extracting 512-dimensional speaker and face embeddings, fine-tune MPNet-v2 for emotion-aware text representations, and adapt these features through emotion-specific MLPs trained on unimodal datasets. MAMBA-based trimodal fusion achieves 64.8% accuracy on MELD and 74.3% on IEMOCAP. These results show that combining identity-based audio and visual embeddings with emotion-tuned text representations on a quality-controlled subset of data yields consistent competitive performance for multimodal emotion recognition in conversation and provides a basis for further improvement on challenging, low-frequency emotion classes.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in generating structured diagrams from natural language descriptions. In particular, they have shown great promise in generating sequence diagrams for software engineering, typically represented in a text-based syntax such as Mermaid. However, systematic evaluations in this space remain underdeveloped as there is a lack of existing benchmarks to assess the LLM's correctness in this task. To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows. These were expanded via a hybrid methodology combining human annotation, in-context LLM prompting, and rule-based variation generation. Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark. Our results reveal significant capability gaps across models and evaluation modes. Our proposed benchmark provides a foundation for advancing research in structured diagram generation and for developing more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation methodologies.",human
"The law draws a sharp distinction between objects and persons, and between two kinds of persons, the ''fictional'' kind (i.e. corporations), and the ''non-fictional'' kind (individual or ''natural'' persons). This paper will assess whether we maximize overall long-term legal coherence by (A) maintaining an object classification for all future AI systems, (B) creating fictional legal persons associated with suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (giving these fictional legal persons derogable rights and duties associated with certified groups of existing persons, potentially including free speech, contract rights, and standing to sue ''on behalf of'' the AI system), or (C) recognizing non-fictional legal personhood through legal identity for suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (recognizing them as entities meriting legal standing with non-derogable rights which for the human case include life, due process, habeas corpus, freedom from slavery, and freedom of conscience). We will clarify the meaning and implications of each option along the way, considering liability, copyright, family law, fundamental rights, civil rights, citizenship, and AI safety regulation. We will tentatively find that the non-fictional personhood approach may be best from a coherence perspective, for at least some advanced AI systems. An object approach may prove untenable for sufficiently humanoid advanced systems, though we suggest that it is adequate for currently existing systems as of 2025. While fictional personhood would resolve some coherence issues for future systems, it would create others and provide solutions that are neither durable nor fit for purpose. Finally, our review will suggest that ''hybrid'' approaches are likely to fail and lead to further incoherence: the choice between object, fictional person and non-fictional person is unavoidable.",human
"Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.",human
"We introduce Graph Memory (GM), a structured non-parametric framework that augments embedding-based inference with a compact, relational memory over region-level prototypes. Rather than treating each training instance in isolation, GM summarizes the embedding space into prototype nodes annotated with reliability indicators and connected by edges that encode geometric and contextual relations. This design unifies instance retrieval, prototype-based reasoning, and graph-based label propagation within a single inductive model that supports both efficient inference and faithful explanation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets including breast histopathology (IDC) show that GM achieves accuracy competitive with $k$NN and Label Spreading while offering substantially better calibration and smoother decision boundaries, all with an order of magnitude fewer samples. By explicitly modeling reliability and relational structure, GM provides a principled bridge between local evidence and global consistency in non-parametric learning.",human
"Supervised learning with large-scale data usually leads to complex optimization problems, especially for classification tasks with multiple classes. Stochastic subgradient methods can enable efficient learning with a large number of samples for classification techniques that minimize the average loss over the training samples. However, recent techniques, such as minimax risk classifiers (MRCs), minimize the maximum expected loss and are not amenable to stochastic subgradient methods. In this paper, we present a learning algorithm based on the combination of constraint and column generation that enables efficient learning of MRCs with large-scale data for classification tasks with multiple classes. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm provides upto a 10x speedup for general large-scale data and around a 100x speedup with a sizeable number of classes.",human
"Discrete structures are currently second-class in differentiable programming. Since functions over discrete structures lack overt derivatives, differentiable programs do not differentiate through them and limit where they can be used. For example, when programming a neural network, conditionals and iteration cannot be used everywhere; they can break the derivatives necessary for gradient-based learning to work. This limits the class of differentiable algorithms we can directly express, imposing restraints on how we build neural networks and differentiable programs more generally. However, these restraints are not fundamental. Recent work shows conditionals can be first-class, by compiling them into differentiable form as linear neurons. Similarly, this work shows iteration can be first-class -- by compiling to linear recurrent neurons. We present a minimal typed, higher-order and linear programming language with iteration called $\textsf{Cajal}\scriptstyle(\mathbb{\multimap}, \mathbb{2}, \mathbb{N})$. We prove its programs compile correctly to recurrent neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation, we conduct two experiments where we link these recurrent neurons against a neural network solving an iterative image transformation task. This determines part of its function prior to learning. As a result, the network learns faster and with greater data-efficiency relative to a neural network programmed without first-class iteration. A key lesson is that recurrent neurons enable a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.",human
"This research addresses the significant challenges of energy consumption and environmental impact in laser cutting by proposing novel deep learning (DL) methodologies to achieve energy reduction. Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.",human
"This technical report investigates the performance of pre-trained audio models on COVID-19 detection tasks using established benchmark datasets. We fine-tuned Audio-MAE and three PANN architectures (CNN6, CNN10, CNN14) on the Coswara and COUGHVID datasets, evaluating both intra-dataset and cross-dataset generalization. We implemented a strict demographic stratification by age and gender to prevent models from exploiting spurious correlations between demographic characteristics and COVID-19 status. Intra-dataset results showed moderate performance, with Audio-MAE achieving the strongest result on Coswara (0.82 AUC, 0.76 F1-score), while all models demonstrated limited performance on Coughvid (AUC 0.58-0.63). Cross-dataset evaluation revealed severe generalization failure across all models (AUC 0.43-0.68), with Audio-MAE showing strong performance degradation (F1-score 0.00-0.08). Our experiments demonstrate that demographic balancing, while reducing apparent model performance, provides more realistic assessment of COVID-19 detection capabilities by eliminating demographic leakage - a confounding factor that inflate performance metrics. Additionally, the limited dataset sizes after balancing (1,219-2,160 samples) proved insufficient for deep learning models that typically require substantially larger training sets. These findings highlight fundamental challenges in developing generalizable audio-based COVID-19 detection systems and underscore the importance of rigorous demographic controls for clinically robust model evaluation.",human
"Large language models trained on clinical text risk exposing sensitive patient information, yet differential privacy (DP) methods often severely degrade the diagnostic accuracy needed for deployment. Despite rapid progress in DP optimisation and text generation, it remains unclear which privacy-preserving strategy actually works best for clinical language tasks. We present the first systematic head-to-head comparison of four training pipelines for automated diagnostic coding from hospital discharge summaries. All pipelines use identical 1B-parameter models and matched privacy budgets to predict ICD-9 codes. At moderate and relaxed privacy budgets ($\varepsilon \in \{4, 6\}$), knowledge distillation from DP-trained teachers outperforms both direct DP-SGD and DP-synthetic data training, recovering up to 63\% of the non-private performance whilst maintaining strong empirical privacy (membership-inference AUC $\approx$ 0.5). These findings expose large differences in the privacy-utility trade-off across architectures and identify knowledge distillation as the most practical route to privacy-preserving clinical NLP.",human
"In this paper, we provide a novel measure for greenwashing -- i.e., climate-related misinformation -- that shows how polluting companies can use social media advertising related to climate change to redirect criticism. To do so, we identify greenwashing content in 11 million social-political ads in Meta's Ad Targeting Datset with a measurement technique that combines large language models, human coders, and advances in Bayesian item response theory. We show that what is called greenwashing has diverse actors and components, but we also identify a very pernicious form, which we call political greenwashing, that appears to be promoted by fossil fuel companies and related interest groups. Based on ad targeting data, we show that much of this advertising happens via organizations with undisclosed links to the fossil fuel industry. Furthermore, we show that greenwashing ad content is being micro-targeted at left-leaning communities with fossil fuel assets, though we also find comparatively little evidence of ad targeting aimed at influencing public opinion at the national level.",human
"Deep graph learning has advanced Alzheimer's (AD) disease classification from MRI, but most models remain correlational, confounding demographic and genetic factors with disease specific features. We present Causal-GCN, an interventional graph convolutional framework that integrates do-calculus-based back-door adjustment to identify brain regions exerting stable causal influence on AD progression. Each subject's MRI is represented as a structural connectome where nodes denote cortical and subcortical regions and edges encode anatomical connectivity. Confounders such as age, sec, and APOE4 genotype are summarized via principal components and included in the causal adjustment set. After training, interventions on individual regions are simulated by serving their incoming edges and altering node features to estimate average causal effects on disease probability. Applied to 484 subjects from the ADNI cohort, Causal-GCN achieves performance comparable to baseline GNNs while providing interpretable causal effect rankings that highlight posterior, cingulate, and insular hubs consistent with established AD neuropathology.",human
"Neural networks exhibit severe brittleness to semantically irrelevant transformations. A mere 75ms electrocardiogram (ECG) phase shift degrades latent cosine similarity from 1.0 to 0.2, while sensor rotations collapse activity recognition performance with inertial measurement units (IMUs). We identify the root cause as ""laissez-faire"" representation learning, where latent spaces evolve unconstrained provided task performance is satisfied. We propose Structured Contrastive Learning (SCL), a framework that partitions latent space representations into three semantic groups: invariant features that remain consistent under given transformations (e.g., phase shifts or rotations), variant features that actively differentiate transformations via a novel variant mechanism, and free features that preserve task flexibility. This creates controllable push-pull dynamics where different latent dimensions serve distinct, interpretable purposes. The variant mechanism enhances contrastive learning by encouraging variant features to differentiate within positive pairs, enabling simultaneous robustness and interpretability. Our approach requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly into existing training pipelines. Experiments on ECG phase invariance and IMU rotation robustness demonstrate superior performance: ECG similarity improves from 0.25 to 0.91 under phase shifts, while WISDM activity recognition achieves 86.65% accuracy with 95.38% rotation consistency, consistently outperforming traditional data augmentation. This work represents a paradigm shift from reactive data augmentation to proactive structural learning, enabling interpretable latent representations in neural networks.",human
"In this study, we evaluate open-source models for security incident classification, comparing them with proprietary models. We utilize a dataset of anonymized real incidents, categorized according to the NIST SP 800-61r3 taxonomy and processed using five prompt-engineering techniques (PHP, SHP, HTP, PRP, and ZSL). The results indicate that, although proprietary models still exhibit higher accuracy, locally deployed open-source models provide advantages in privacy, cost-effectiveness, and data sovereignty.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains. The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve more reliable and informed problem-solving while maintaining task performance using our framework.",human
"The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones.   To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT.",human
"We present an unsupervised single image bidirectional Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) synthesizer that synthesizes an Ultra-Low Field (ULF) like image from a High-Field (HF) magnitude image and vice-versa. Unlike existing MRI synthesis models, our approach is inspired by the physics that drives contrast changes between HF and ULF MRIs. Our forward model simulates a HF to ULF transformation by estimating the tissue-type Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) values based on target contrast values. For the Super-Resolution task, we used an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) network to synthesize HF image by simultaneously predicting tissue-type segmentations and image intensity without observed HF data. The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic ULF-like data from generated from standard 3T T$_1$-weighted images for qualitative assessments and paired 3T-64mT T$_1$-weighted images for validation experiments. WM-GM contrast improved by 52% in synthetic ULF-like images and 37% in 64mT images. Sensitivity experiments demonstrated the robustness of our forward model to variations in target contrast, noise and initial seeding.",human
"As Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations rapidly expand to hundreds and thousands of spacecraft, the need for distributed on-board machine learning becomes critical to address downlink bandwidth limitations. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising framework to conduct collaborative model training across satellite networks. Realizing its benefits in space naturally requires addressing space-specific constraints, from intermittent connectivity to dynamics imposed by orbital motion. This work presents the first systematic feasibility analysis of adapting off-the-shelf FL algorithms for satellite constellation deployment. We introduce a comprehensive ""space-ification"" framework that adapts terrestrial algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBuff) to operate under orbital constraints, producing an orbital-ready suite of FL algorithms. We then evaluate these space-ified methods through extensive parameter sweeps across 768 constellation configurations that vary cluster sizes (1-10), satellites per cluster (1-10), and ground station networks (1-13). Our analysis demonstrates that space-adapted FL algorithms efficiently scale to constellations of up to 100 satellites, achieving performance close to the centralized ideal. Multi-month training cycles can be reduced to days, corresponding to a 9x speedup through orbital scheduling and local coordination within satellite clusters. These results provide actionable insights for future mission designers, enabling distributed on-board learning for more autonomous, resilient, and data-driven satellite operations.",human
"Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.",human
"The rapid advancement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft offers a promising opportunity to alleviate urban traffic congestion. Thus, developing optimal takeoff trajectories for minimum energy consumption becomes essential for broader eVTOL aircraft applications. Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.",human
"In this paper, we study the exact learning problem for weighted graphs, where we are given the vertex set, $V$, of a weighted graph, $G=(V,E,w)$, but we are not given $E$. The problem, which is also known as graph reconstruction, is to determine all the edges of $E$, including their weights, by asking queries about $G$ from an oracle. As we observe, using simple shortest-path length queries is not sufficient, in general, to learn a weighted graph. So we study a number of scenarios where it is possible to learn $G$ using a subquadratic number of composite queries, which combine two or three simple queries.",human
"To autonomously control vehicles, driving agents use outputs from a combination of machine-learning (ML) models, controller logic, and custom modules. Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.   To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.   We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.",human
"This paper presents a novel geometric representation for CAD Boundary Representation (B-Rep) based on volumetric distance functions, dubbed B-Rep Distance Functions (BR-DF). BR-DF encodes the surface mesh geometry of a CAD model as signed distance function (SDF). B-Rep vertices, edges, faces and their topology information are encoded as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDFs). An extension of the Marching Cubes algorithm converts BR-DF directly into watertight CAD B-Rep model (strictly speaking a faceted B-Rep model). A surprising characteristic of BR-DF is that this conversion process never fails. Leveraging the volumetric nature of BR-DF, we propose a multi-branch latent diffusion with 3D U-Net backbone for jointly generating the SDF and per-face UDFs of a BR-DF model. Our approach achieves comparable CAD generation performance against SOTA methods while reaching the unprecedented 100% success rate in producing (faceted) B-Rep models.",human
"Large language models produce powerful text embeddings, but their causal attention mechanism restricts the flow of information from later to earlier tokens, degrading representation quality. While recent methods attempt to solve this by prepending a single summary token, they over-compress information, hence harming performance on long documents. We propose Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP), a method that resolves two critical bottlenecks. To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow. To address readout-level over-squashing, we replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling, a choice supported by theoretical analysis. HTP achieves consistent performance gains across 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context settings. As a simple, architecture-agnostic method, HTP enhances both zero-shot and finetuned models, offering a scalable route to superior long-document embeddings.",human
"Transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in sequential recommendation systems, yet their application in Financial Services (FS) presents distinct practical and modeling challenges for real-time recommendation. These include:a) long-range user interactions (implicit and explicit) spanning both digital and physical channels generating temporally heterogeneous context, b) the presence of multiple interrelated products require coordinated models to support varied ad placements and personalized feeds, while balancing competing business goals. We propose FinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. While tree-based models have traditionally been preferred in FS due to their explainability and alignment with regulatory requirements, our study demonstrate that FinTRec offers a viable and effective shift toward transformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we show FinTRec consistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned for product adaptation, enables cross-product signal sharing, reduces training cost and technical debt, while improving offline performance across all products. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of unified sequential recommendation modeling in FS that addresses both technical and business considerations.",human
"Accurate identification and segmentation of dental caries in panoramic radiographs are critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Automated segmentation remains challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and state-space mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs through a DC1000 dataset. Twelve state-of-the-art architectures, including VMUnet, MambaUNet, VMUNetv2, RMAMamba-S, TransNetR, PVTFormer, DoubleU-Net, and ResUNet++, were trained under identical configurations. Results reveal that, contrary to the growing trend toward complex attention based architectures, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145, outperforming all transformer and Mamba variants. In the study, the top 3 results across all performance metrics were achieved by CNN-based architectures. Here, Mamba and transformer-based methods, despite their theoretical advantage in global context modeling, underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors. These findings underscore the importance of architecture-task alignment in domain-specific medical image segmentation more than model complexity.

"Assuring the trustworthiness and safety of AI systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles (AV), depends critically on the data-related safety properties, e.g., representativeness, completeness, etc., of the datasets used for their training and testing. Among these properties, this paper focuses on representativeness-the extent to which the scenario-based data used for training and testing, reflect the operational conditions that the system is designed to operate safely in, i.e., Operational Design Domain (ODD) or expected to encounter, i.e., Target Operational Domain (TOD). We propose a probabilistic method that quantifies representativeness by comparing the statistical distribution of features encoded by the scenario suites with the corresponding distribution of features representing the TOD, acknowledging that the true TOD distribution is unknown, as it can only be inferred from limited data.   We apply an imprecise Bayesian method to handle limited data and uncertain priors. The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value. We present a numerical example comparing the distributions of the scenario suite and the inferred TOD across operational categories-weather, road type, time of day, etc., under dependencies and prior uncertainty. We estimate representativeness locally (between categories) and globally as an interval.",human
"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) promise higher expressive capability and stronger interpretability than Multi-Layer Perceptron, particularly in the domain of AI for Science. However, practical adoption has been hindered by low GPU utilization of existing parallel implementations. To address this challenge, we present a GPU-accelerated operator library, named PolyKAN which is the first general open-source implementation of KAN and its variants. PolyKAN fuses the forward and backward passes of polynomial KAN layers into a concise set of optimized CUDA kernels. Four orthogonal techniques underpin the design: (i) \emph{lookup-table} with linear interpolation that replaces runtime expensive math-library functions; (ii) \emph{2D tiling} to expose thread-level parallelism with preserving memory locality; (iii) a \emph{two-stage reduction} scheme converting scattered atomic updates into a single controllable merge step; and (iv) \emph{coefficient-layout reordering} yielding unit-stride reads under the tiled schedule. Using a KAN variant, Chebyshev KAN, as a case-study, PolyKAN delivers $1.2$--$10\times$ faster inference and $1.4$--$12\times$ faster training than a Triton + cuBLAS baseline, with identical accuracy on speech, audio-enhancement, and tabular-regression workloads on both highend GPU and consumer-grade GPU.",human
"Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) - where models iteratively reason, generate code, and verify through execution - remains challenging for existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Current RL methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from coarse-grained, trajectory-level rewards that provide insufficient learning signals for complex multi-turn interactions, leading to training stagnation. To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, establishing its effectiveness for advancing complex mathematical reasoning in the real world.",human
"Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.",human
"The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a ""canvas"" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.",human
"We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.",human
"As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.",human
"Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.",human
"Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $η>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $ρ_k^η$ that approximate to first order in $η$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $λ$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $η$. We show that $ρ_k^η$ are approximated to order $η^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \emph{modified} energy \[ J^η(ρ) = J(ρ) - \fracη{4}\int_M \Big\lVert \nabla_g \frac{δJ}{δρ} (ρ) \Big\rVert_{2}^{2} \,ρ(dx), \] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $η/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $η$ a \textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{ä}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^η$ we study \emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^η$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.",human
"On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.",human
"Deep learning's rise since the early 2010s has transformed fields like computer vision and natural language processing and strongly influenced biomedical research. For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's ""ImageNet moment"" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.",human
"Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP model that captures the dynamics of ratings over time while additionally accounting for review heterogeneity. Based on 121,123 ratings from Yelp, we compare the predictive power of different rating aggregation methods in predicting future ratings, thereby finding that the GP model is considerably more accurate and reduces the mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean. Our findings have important implications for marketing practitioners and customers. By moving beyond means, designers of online reputation systems can display more informative and adaptive aggregated rating scores that are accurate signals of expected customer satisfaction.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD.",human
"Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.",human
"We improve the complex number identity proving method to a fully automated procedure, based on elimination ideals. By using declarative equations or rewriting each real-relational hypothesis $h_i$ to $h_i-r_i$, and the thesis $t$ to $t-r$, clearing the denominators and introducing an extra expression with a slack variable, we eliminate all free and relational point variables. From the obtained ideal $I$ in $\mathbb{Q}[r,r_1,r_2,\ldots]$ we can find a conclusive result. It plays an important role that if $r_1,r_2,\ldots$ are real, $r$ must also be real if there is a linear polynomial $p(r)\in I$, unless division by zero occurs when expressing $r$. Our results are presented in Mathematica, Maple and in a new version of the Giac computer algebra system.

"Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $δ$, and linearly ($\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $δ$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.   We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.",human
"We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.",human
"Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE",human
"We establish the first global convergence result of neural networks for two stage least squares (2SLS) approach in nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV). This is achieved by adopting a lifted perspective through mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD), unlike standard MFLD, however, our setting of 2SLS entails a \emph{bilevel} optimization problem in the space of probability measures. To address this challenge, we leverage the penalty gradient approach recently developed for bilevel optimization which formulates bilevel optimization as a Lagrangian problem. This leads to a novel fully first-order algorithm, termed \texttt{F$^2$BMLD}. Apart from the convergence bound, we further provide a generalization bound, revealing an inherent trade-off in the choice of the Lagrange multiplier between optimization and statistical guarantees. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on an offline reinforcement learning benchmark.",human
"QML-HCS is a research-grade framework for constructing and analyzing quantum-inspired machine learning models operating under hypercausal feedback dynamics. Hypercausal refers to AI systems that leverage extended, deep, or nonlinear causal relationships (expanded causality) to reason, predict, and infer states beyond the capabilities of traditional causal models. Current machine learning and quantum-inspired systems struggle in non-stationary environments, where data distributions drift and models lack mechanisms for continuous adaptation, causal stability, and coherent state updating. QML-HCS addresses this limitation through a unified computational architecture that integrates quantum-inspired superposition principles, dynamic causal feedback, and deterministic-stochastic hybrid execution to enable adaptive behavior in changing environments.   The framework implements a hypercausal processing core capable of reversible transformations, multipath causal propagation, and evaluation of alternative states under drift. Its architecture incorporates continuous feedback to preserve causal consistency and adjust model behavior without requiring full retraining. QML-HCS provides a reproducible and extensible Python interface backed by efficient computational routines, enabling experimentation in quantum-inspired learning, causal reasoning, and hybrid computation without the need for specialized hardware.   A minimal simulation demonstrates how a hypercausal model adapts to a sudden shift in the input distribution while preserving internal coherence. This initial release establishes the foundational architecture for future theoretical extensions, benchmarking studies, and integration with classical and quantum simulation platforms.",human
"This study analyzes the multiple functions of Large Language Models (LLMs) in transforming research and development (R&D) processes.

"Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to ""see beyond the image"", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.",human
"Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.",human
"We investigate tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings by comparing word-level, morpheme-based, and BPE approaches on morphological similarity preservation tasks. We develop a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation and evaluate Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization. Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\% of test cases compared to 68.7\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. When assessed comprehensively, morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels. These findings highlight the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing and offers different tokenization methods for low-resourced language processing.",human
"Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental ""grammar"" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.",human
"Existing approaches to complaint analysis largely rely on unimodal, short-form content such as tweets or product reviews. This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images. This study underscores the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems.

"Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\% and 78.08\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.",human
"Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.",human
"Historical and low-resource NLP remains challenging due to limited annotated data and domain mismatches with modern, web-sourced corpora. This paper outlines our work in using large language models (LLMs) to create ground-truth annotations for historical French (16th-20th centuries) and Chinese (1900-1950) texts. By leveraging LLM-generated ground truth on a subset of our corpus, we were able to fine-tune spaCy to achieve significant gains on period-specific tests for part-of-speech (POS) annotations, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.",human
"Large Language Models have demonstrated the ability to generalize well at many levels across domains, modalities, and even shown in-context learning capabilities. This enables research questions regarding how they can be used to encode physical information that is usually only available from scientific measurements, and loosely encoded in textual descriptions. Using astrophysics as a test bed, we investigate if LLM embeddings can codify physical summary statistics that are obtained from scientific measurements through two main questions: 1) Does prompting play a role on how those quantities are codified by the LLM? and 2) What aspects of language are most important in encoding the physics represented by the measurement? We investigate this using sparse autoencoders that extract interpretable features from the text.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) often make reasoning errors when solving mathematical problems, and how to automatically detect and correct these errors has become an important research direction. However, existing approaches \textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{SMRC} (\textit{\underline{S}tudent \underline{M}athematical \underline{R}easoning \underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \textbf{solution accuracy} and \textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

"Heaps' or Herdan's law characterizes the word-type vs. word-token relation by a power-law function, which is concave in linear-linear scale but a straight line in log-log scale. However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement"" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance"" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.",human
"Smoking continues to be a major preventable cause of death worldwide, affecting millions through damage to the heart, metabolism, liver, and kidneys. However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.",human
"Probabilistic load forecasting is widely studied and underpins power system planning, operation, and risk-aware decision making. Deep learning forecasters have shown strong ability to capture complex temporal and contextual patterns, achieving substantial accuracy gains. However, at the scale of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of loads in large distribution feeders, a deployment dilemma emerges: training and maintaining one model per customer is computationally and storage intensive, while using a single global model ignores distributional shifts across customer types, locations, and phases. Prior work typically focuses on single-load forecasters, global models across multiple loads, or adaptive/personalized models for relatively small settings, and rarely addresses the combined challenges of heterogeneity and scalability in large feeders. We propose M2OE2-GL, a global-to-local extension of the M2OE2 probabilistic forecaster. We first pretrain a single global M2OE2 base model across all feeder loads, then apply lightweight fine-tuning to derive a compact family of group-specific forecasters. Evaluated on realistic utility data, M2OE2-GL yields substantial error reductions while remaining scalable to very large numbers of loads.",human
"Contract management involves reviewing and negotiating provisions, individual clauses that define rights, obligations, and terms of agreement. During this process, revisions to provisions are proposed and iteratively refined, some of which may be problematic or unacceptable. Automating this workflow is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data and the abundance of unstructured legacy contracts. In this paper, we present a modular framework designed to streamline contract management through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system integrates synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment to flag problematic revisions and generate improved alternatives. Developed and evaluated in collaboration with an industry partner, our system achieves over 80% accuracy in both identifying and optimizing problematic revisions, demonstrating strong performance under real-world, low-resource conditions and offering a practical means of accelerating contract revision workflows.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.",human
"Annotation bias in NLP datasets remains a major challenge for developing multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in culturally diverse settings. Bias from task framing, annotator subjectivity, and cultural mismatches can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms. We propose a comprehensive framework for understanding annotation bias, distinguishing among instruction bias, annotator bias, and contextual and cultural bias. We review detection methods (including inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, and metadata analysis) and highlight emerging techniques such as multilingual model divergence and cultural inference. We further outline proactive and reactive mitigation strategies, including diverse annotator recruitment, iterative guideline refinement, and post-hoc model adjustments. Our contributions include: (1) a typology of annotation bias; (2) a synthesis of detection metrics; (3) an ensemble-based bias mitigation approach adapted for multilingual settings, and (4) an ethical analysis of annotation processes. Together, these insights aim to inform more equitable and culturally grounded annotation pipelines for LLMs.",human
"Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.",human
"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), affecting millions worldwide, exhibits complex pathophysiology manifested through disrupted brain network dynamics. Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\% and an AUROC of 76.4\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.",human
"Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

"As foundation models are increasingly deployed as interacting agents in multi-agent systems, their collective behavior raises new challenges for trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability. Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps. Beyond these improvements, our findings demonstrate that economic coordination principles can operationalize accountability and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable pathway toward self-correcting, socially responsible AI capable of maintaining trust and oversight in real world deployment scenarios.",human

This technical note provides a comprehensive and detailed discussion of the derivative of the truncated singular and eigenvalue decomposition.

A main focus is correctly expressing the derivative in terms of the truncated part, despite lacking knowledge of the full decomposition.",human
"Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.",human
"Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.",human
"Radio spectrum monitoring in contested environments motivates the need for reliable automatic signal classification technology. Prior work highlights deep learning as a promising approach, but existing models depend on brute-force Doppler augmentation to achieve real-world generalization, which undermines both training efficiency and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with complex-valued layers that exploits convolutional shift equivariance in the frequency domain. To establish provable frequency bin shift invariance, we use adaptive polyphase sampling (APS) as pooling layers followed by a global average pooling layer at the end of the network. Using a synthetic dataset of common interference signals, experimental results demonstrate that unlike a vanilla CNN, our model maintains consistent classification accuracy with and without random Doppler shifts despite being trained on no Doppler-shifted examples. Overall, our method establishes an invariance-driven framework for signal classification that offers provable robustness against real-world effects.",human
"Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.",human
"In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.",human
"We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

"Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of ""1"" 49% of the time produces an answer of ""0"" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.",human
"Robophysics investigates the physical principles that govern living-like robots operating in complex, realworld environments. Despite remarkable technological advances, robots continue to face fundamental efficiency limitations. At the level of individual units, locomotion remains a challenge, while at the collective level, robot swarms struggle to achieve shared purpose, coordination, communication, and cost efficiency. This perspective article examines the key challenges faced by bio-inspired robotic collectives and highlights recent research efforts that incorporate principles from active-matter physics and biology into the modeling and design of robot swarms.",human
"Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.",human
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become critical for advancing modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing synchronous RL systems face severe performance bottlenecks. The rollout phase, which dominates end-to-end iteration time, suffers from substantial long-tail latency and poor resource utilization due to inherent workload imbalance. We present Seer, a novel online context learning system that addresses these challenges by exploiting previously overlooked similarities in output lengths and generation patterns among requests sharing the same prompt. Seer introduces three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding. Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout. Evaluations on production-grade RL workloads demonstrate that Seer improves end-to-end rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93% compared to state-of-the-art synchronous RL systems, significantly accelerating RL training iterations.",human
"Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose SpotlightTTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability.",human
"Contemporary machine learning models, including large language models, exhibit remarkable capabilities in static tasks yet falter in non-stationary environments due to rigid architectures that hinder continual adaptation and lifelong learning. Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts. Through rigorous mathematical formulations, theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret in varying regimes, alongside empirical demonstrations of superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, dynamic nested hierarchies establish a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence.",human
"Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.",human
"Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.",human
"Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.",human
"The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.",human
"High quality summarization data remains scarce in under-represented languages. However, historical newspapers, made available through recent digitization efforts, offer an abundant source of untapped, naturally annotated data. In this work, we present a novel method for collecting naturally occurring summaries via Front-Page Teasers, where editors summarize full length articles. We show that this phenomenon is common across seven diverse languages and supports multi-document summarization. To scale data collection, we develop an automatic process, suited to varying linguistic resource levels. Finally, we apply this process to a Hebrew newspaper title, producing HEBTEASESUM, the first dedicated multi-document summarization dataset in Hebrew.",human
"Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.",human
"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.",human
"Humans increasingly interact with artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making. However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.",human
"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.",human
"Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.",human
"Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.",human
"The use of machine learning to represent subgrid-scale (SGS) dynamics is now well established in weather forecasting and climate modelling. Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes.",human
"Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.",human
"Accessing 3D models remains challenging for Screen Reader (SR) users. While some existing 3D viewers allow creators to provide alternative text, they often lack sufficient detail about the 3D models. Grounded on a formative study, this paper introduces SweeperBot, a system that enables SR users to leverage visual question answering to explore and compare 3D models. SweeperBot answers SR users' visual questions by combining an optimal view selection technique with the strength of generative- and recognition-based foundation models. An expert review with 10 Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users with SR experience demonstrated the feasibility of using SweeperBot to assist BLV users in exploring and comparing 3D models. The quality of the descriptions generated by SweeperBot was validated by a second survey study with 30 sighted participants.",human
"Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.",human
"Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

"Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.",human
"Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is a flourishing non-invasive approach to brain modulation with wide-ranging applications in neuromedicine and cognitive neuroscience. However, progress in DecNef research remains constrained by subject-dependent learning variability, reliance on indirect measures to quantify progress, and the high cost and time demands of experimentation.   We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning.   We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation.   In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation.",human
"Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.",human

"Structural nested mean models (SNMMs) are a principled approach to estimate the treatment effects over time. A particular strength of SNMMs is to break the joint effect of treatment sequences over time into localized, time-specific ``blip effects''. This decomposition promotes interpretability through the incremental effects and enables the efficient offline evaluation of optimal treatment policies without re-computation. However, neural frameworks for SNMMs are lacking, as their inherently sequential g-estimation scheme prevents end-to-end, gradient-based training. Here, we propose DeepBlip, the first neural framework for SNMMs, which overcomes this limitation with a novel double optimization trick to enable simultaneous learning of all blip functions. Our DeepBlip seamlessly integrates sequential neural networks like LSTMs or transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies. By design, our method correctly adjusts for time-varying confounding to produce unbiased estimates, and its Neyman-orthogonal loss function ensures robustness to nuisance model misspecification. Finally, we evaluate our DeepBlip across various clinical datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.",human
"Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.",human
"Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.   We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.   Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.",human
"Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.",human
"With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.",human
"Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.",human
"Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.",human
"Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a significant challenge for speech enhancement (SE) tasks on resource-constrained devices. Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as MUSE, have established a strong baseline with only 0.51M parameters by introducing a Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) transformer and Deformable Embedding (DE). However, an in-depth analysis reveals that MUSE still suffers from efficiency bottlenecks: the MET module relies on a complex ""approximate-compensate"" mechanism to mitigate the limitations of Taylor-expansion-based attention, while the offset calculation for deformable embedding introduces additional computational burden. This paper proposes IMSE, a systematically optimized and ultra-lightweight network. We introduce two core innovations: 1) Replacing the MET module with Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA). MALA fundamentally rectifies the ""amplitude-ignoring"" problem in linear attention by explicitly preserving the norm information of query vectors in the attention calculation, achieving efficient global modeling without an auxiliary compensation branch. 2) Replacing the DE module with Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv). IDConv borrows the Inception concept, decomposing large-kernel operations into efficient parallel branches (square, horizontal, and vertical strips), thereby capturing spectrogram features with extremely low parameter redundancy. Extensive experiments on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset demonstrate that, compared to the MUSE baseline, IMSE significantly reduces the parameter count by 16.8\% (from 0.513M to 0.427M) while achieving competitive performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PESQ metric (3.373). This study sets a new benchmark for the trade-off between model size and speech quality in ultra-lightweight speech enhancement.",human
"Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.",human
"The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.",human
"Communication compression is essential for scalable distributed training of modern machine learning models, but it often degrades convergence due to the noise it introduces. Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes. Specifically, we show that normalized EF21 achieve the convergence rate of near ${O}(1/T^{1/4})$ for Polyak's heavy-ball momentum, ${O}(1/T^{2/7})$ for Iterative Gradient Transport (IGT), and ${O}(1/T^{1/3})$ for STORM and Hessian-corrected momentum. Our results hold with decreasing stepsizes and small mini-batches. Finally, our empirical experiments confirm our theoretical insights.",human
"Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PAFM-03B2.",human
"These notes provide a self-contained introduction to kernel methods and their geometric foundations in machine learning. Starting from the construction of Hilbert spaces, we develop the theory of positive definite kernels, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), and Hilbert-Schmidt operators, emphasizing their role in statistical estimation and representation of probability measures. Classical concepts such as covariance, regression, and information measures are revisited through the lens of Hilbert space geometry. We also introduce kernel density estimation, kernel embeddings of distributions, and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The exposition is designed to serve as a foundation for more advanced topics, including Gaussian processes, kernel Bayesian inference, and functional analytic approaches to modern machine learning.",human
"Join ordering is the NP-hard problem of selecting the most efficient sequence in which to evaluate joins (conjunctive, binary operators) in a database query. As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future.",human
"This paper introduces Tensor Gauge Flow Models, a new class of Generative Flow Models that generalize Gauge Flow Models and Higher Gauge Flow Models by incorporating higher-order Tensor Gauge Fields into the Flow Equation. This extension allows the model to encode richer geometric and gauge-theoretic structure in the data, leading to more expressive flow dynamics. Experiments on Gaussian mixture models show that Tensor Gauge Flow Models achieve improved generative performance compared to both standard and gauge flow baselines.",human
"Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for ""agentic AI,"" with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.",human
"Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collect alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095 participants, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% higher on EA than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?",human
"Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.",human
"Using multiple carousels, lists that wrap around and can be scrolled, is the basis for offering content in most contemporary movie streaming platforms. Carousels allow for highlighting different aspects of users' taste, that fall in categories such as genres and authors. However, while carousels offer structure and greater ease of navigation, they alone do not increase diversity in recommendations, while this is essential to keep users engaged. In this work we propose several approaches to effectively increase item diversity within the domain of book recommendations, on top of a collaborative filtering algorithm. These approaches are intended to improve book recommendations in the web catalogs of public libraries. Furthermore, we introduce metrics to evaluate the resulting strategies, and show that the proposed system finds a suitable balance between accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.",human
"Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm for training machine learning (ML) models without sharing data. While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.   Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model. Our results offer insights for researchers and software architects aiming to build robust FL systems.",human
"We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.",human
"Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.",human
"Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.",human
"We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.",human
"To distinguish Markov equivalent graphs in causal discovery, it is necessary to restrict the structural causal model. Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \to Y$ and $Y \to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets. Throughout our experiments, SkewD exhibits a strong performance and, in comparison to prior work, remains robust under high skewness.",human
"Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.",human
"Assuring the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous systems is particularly difficult when learning-enabled components and open environments are involved. Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy.",human
"Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be both safe and trustworthy to gain social acceptance and become a viable option for everyday public transportation. Explanations about the system behaviour can increase safety and trust in AVs. Unfortunately, explaining the system behaviour of AI-based driving functions is particularly challenging, as decision-making processes are often opaque. The field of Explainability Engineering tackles this challenge by developing explanation models at design time. These models are designed from system design artefacts and stakeholder needs to develop correct and good explanations. To support this field, we propose an approach that enables context-aware, ante-hoc explanations of (un)expectable driving manoeuvres at runtime. The visual yet formal language Traffic Sequence Charts is used to formalise explanation contexts, as well as corresponding (un)expectable driving manoeuvres. A dedicated runtime monitoring enables context-recognition and ante-hoc presentation of explanations at runtime. In combination, we aim to support the bridging of correct and good explanations. Our method is demonstrated in a simulated overtaking.",human
"Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.",human
"In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.",human
"In decentralized machine learning paradigms such as Split Federated Learning (SFL) and its variant U-shaped SFL, the server's capabilities are severely restricted. Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels.   To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness.",human
"Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently become a significant area of focus within Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning.",human
"Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.",human
"Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.",human
"Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.",human
"Enterprise ERP systems managing hundreds of thousands of employee records face critical data quality challenges when human resources departments perform decentralized manual entry across multiple languages. We present an end-to-end pipeline combining automated data cleaning with LLM-driven SQL query generation, deployed on a production system managing 240,000 employee records over six months.   The system operates in two integrated stages: a multi-stage cleaning pipeline that performs translation normalization, spelling correction, and entity deduplication during periodic synchronization from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL; and a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by GPT-4o that translates natural-language questions in Turkish, Russian, and English into validated SQL queries. The query engine employs LangChain orchestration, FAISS vector similarity search, and few-shot learning with 500+ validated examples.   Our evaluation demonstrates 92.5% query validity, 95.1% schema compliance, and 90.7\% semantic accuracy on 2,847 production queries. The system reduces query turnaround time from 2.3 days to under 5 seconds while maintaining 99.2% uptime, with GPT-4o achieving 46% lower latency and 68% cost reduction versus GPT-3.5. This modular architecture provides a reproducible framework for AI-native enterprise data governance, demonstrating real-world viability at enterprise scale with 4.3/5.0 user satisfaction.",human
"Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.",human
"Due to the high cost of annotation or the rarity of some diseases, medical image segmentation is often limited by data scarcity and the resulting overfitting problem. Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks. The source code is available in https://github.com/DanielaPlusPlus/HSMix.",human
"Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.",human
"While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.",human
"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable ""ruler"" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.",human
"The application of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is frequently hampered by a ""tokenization bottleneck"", where tokenizers tuned on general-domain text tend to fragment chemical representations such as SMILES into semantically uninformative sub-tokens. This paper introduces a principled methodology to resolve this bottleneck by unifying the representation of natural language and molecular structures within a single model. Our approach involves targeted vocabulary extension-augmenting a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically salient tokens, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text to integrate this new knowledge. We provide an empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that our methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks.",human
"The accelerating growth of scientific publications has intensified the need for scalable, trustworthy systems to synthesize knowledge across diverse literature. While recent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have improved access to scientific information, they often overlook citation graph structure, adapt poorly to complex queries, and yield fragmented, hard-to-verify syntheses. We introduce SciRAG, an open-source framework for scientific literature exploration that addresses these gaps through three key innovations: (1) adaptive retrieval that flexibly alternates between sequential and parallel evidence gathering; (2) citation-aware symbolic reasoning that leverages citation graphs to organize and filter supporting documents; and (3) outline-guided synthesis that plans, critiques, and refines answers to ensure coherence and transparent attribution. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks such as QASA and ScholarQA demonstrate that SciRAG outperforms prior systems in factual accuracy and synthesis quality, establishing a new foundation for reliable, large-scale scientific knowledge aggregation.",human
"Blinking is a vital physiological process that protects and maintains the health of the ocular surface. Objective assessment of eyelid movements remains challenging due to the complexity, cost, and limited clinical applicability of existing tools. This study presents the clinical validation of Bapp (Blink Application), a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework and integrated with Google ML Kit for on-device, real-time analysis of eyelid movements. The validation occurred using 45 videos from real patients, whose blinks were manually annotated by ophthalmology specialists from the Paulista School of Medicine of the Federal University of Sao Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) to serve as the ground truth. Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.",human
"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.",human
"Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.",human
"Place recognition, the ability to identify previously visited locations, is critical for both biological navigation and autonomous systems. This review synthesizes findings from robotic systems, animal studies, and human research to explore how different systems encode and recall place. We examine the computational and representational strategies employed across artificial systems, animals, and humans, highlighting convergent solutions such as topological mapping, cue integration, and memory management. Animal systems reveal evolved mechanisms for multimodal navigation and environmental adaptation, while human studies provide unique insights into semantic place concepts, cultural influences, and introspective capabilities. Artificial systems showcase scalable architectures and data-driven models. We propose a unifying set of concepts by which to consider and develop place recognition mechanisms and identify key challenges such as generalization, robustness, and environmental variability. This review aims to foster innovations in artificial localization by connecting future developments in artificial place recognition systems to insights from both animal navigation research and human spatial cognition studies.",human
"One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.",human
"With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.",human
"As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.",human
"In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.",human
"Phonocardiogram (PCG) analysis is vital for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the scarcity of labeled pathological data hinders the capability of AI systems. To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata. Our approach features: (1) a multi-scale VAE that learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space, separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; (2) a hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline that leverages rich clinical metadata for fine-grained control over 17 distinct conditions; and (3) an interpretable diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module. Experiments on the PhysioNet CirCor dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Fréchet Audio Distance of 9.7, a 92% attribute disentanglement score, and 87.1% clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists. Augmenting diagnostic models with our synthetic data improves the accuracy of rare disease classification by 11.3\%. H-LDM establishes a new direction for data augmentation in cardiac diagnostics, bridging data scarcity with interpretable clinical insights.",human
"Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.",human
"In this report, we describe our submission to Track 5 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge for the task of Audio Question Answering(AQA). Our system leverages the SSL backbone BEATs to extract frame-level audio features, which are then processed by a classification head to generate segment-level predictions of acoustic events, following the Audioset ontology. These segment-level predictions are subsequently calibrated before producing event-level predictions. Finally, these predictions are incorporated into a structured prompt, along with the question and candidate answers. This prompt is then fed to a fine-tuned version of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, trained using the GRPO algorithm with a simple reward function. Our method achieves an accuracy of 62.6 % on the development set, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining acoustic event reasoning with instruction-tuned large language models for AQA.",human
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a foundational general-purpose technology, raising new dilemmas of sovereignty in an interconnected world. While governments seek greater control over it, the very foundations of AI--global data pipelines, semiconductor supply chains, open-source ecosystems, and international standards--resist enclosure. This paper develops a conceptual and formal framework for understanding sovereign AI as a continuum rather than a binary condition, balancing autonomy with interdependence. Drawing on classical theories, historical analogies, and contemporary debates on networked autonomy, we present a planner's model that identifies two policy heuristics: equalizing marginal returns across the four sovereignty pillars and setting openness where global benefits equal exposure risks.   We apply the model to India, highlighting sovereign footholds in data, compute, and norms but weaker model autonomy. The near-term challenge is integration via coupled Data x Compute investment, lifecycle governance (ModelOps), and safeguarded procurement. We then apply the model to the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and the UAE), where large public investment in Arabic-first models and sovereign cloud implies high sovereignty weights, lower effective fiscal constraints, and strong Data x Compute complementarities. An interior openness setting with guardrails emerges as optimal. Across contexts, the lesson is that sovereignty in AI needs managed interdependence, not isolation.",human
"Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a cornerstone technology in clinical microbiology, enabling rapid and accurate microbial identification. However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.   We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.   Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency. Furthermore, augmenting minority species with synthetic spectra markedly improves classification accuracy, effectively mitigating class imbalance and domain mismatch without compromising the authenticity of the generated data.",human
"Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.",human
"Transformer models are foundational to natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks introduced through poisoned data, which implant hidden behaviors during training. To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.",human
"In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.",human
"We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.",human
"Recent audio-language models have shown impressive performance across a wide range of audio tasks and are increasingly capable of handling long audio inputs. However, the computing costs in these models heavily depend on sequence length, which can become very large given the nature of audio data. In the vision-language domain, token pruning methods have proven effective in reducing token counts while preserving strong performance on standard benchmarks. In this work, we investigate the relevance and effectiveness of such token selection strategies in the context of audio-language models. We also improve them by proposing a lightweight strategy that takes the time dimension into account. While retaining only a quarter of the initial tokens, our approach results in a relative maximum decrease of 2% in CIDEr on Clotho v2 and a relative maximum decrease of 4% in accuracy on MMAU.",human
"Despite recent advancements in neural 3D reconstruction, the dependence on dense multi-view captures restricts their broader applicability. Additionally, 3D scene generation is vital for advancing embodied AI and world models, which depend on diverse, high-quality scenes for learning and evaluation. In this work, we propose Gen3d, a novel method for generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes from a single image. After the initial point cloud is created by lifting the RGBD image, Gen3d maintains and expands its world model. The 3D scene is finalized through optimizing a Gaussian splatting representation. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in generating a world model and Synthesizing high-fidelity and consistent novel views.",human
"We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.",human
"Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.",human
"Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/ContactSoftwareAI/TabEmbedBench.",human
"Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.",human
"Heterogeneous porous materials play a crucial role in various engineering systems. Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures. We conducted experiments on stochastic reconstruction, controllable reconstruction, heterogeneous reconstruction, and large-size microstructure reconstruction across various materials. Comparative analysis through visualization, statistical measures, and physical property simulations demonstrates the effectiveness, providing new insights and possibilities for research on structure-property linkage and material inverse design.",human
"Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE.

"Recent work in deep learning has opened new possibilities for solving classical algorithmic tasks using end-to-end learned models. In this work, we investigate the fundamental task of solving linear systems, particularly those that are ill-conditioned. Existing numerical methods for ill-conditioned systems often require careful parameter tuning, preconditioning, or domain-specific expertise to ensure accuracy and stability. In this work, we propose Algebraformer, a Transformer-based architecture that learns to solve linear systems end-to-end, even in the presence of severe ill-conditioning. Our model leverages a novel encoding scheme that enables efficient representation of matrix and vector inputs, with a memory complexity of $O(n^2)$, supporting scalable inference. We demonstrate its effectiveness on application-driven linear problems, including interpolation tasks from spectral methods for boundary value problems and acceleration of the Newton method. Algebraformer achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational overhead at test time, demonstrating that general-purpose neural architectures can effectively reduce complexity in traditional scientific computing pipelines.",human
"World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.",human
"Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.",human
"Triathlon training, which involves high-volume swimming, cycling, and running, places athletes at substantial risk for overuse injuries due to repetitive physiological stress. Current injury prediction approaches primarily rely on training load metrics, often neglecting critical factors such as sleep quality, stress, and individual lifestyle patterns that significantly influence recovery and injury susceptibility.   We introduce a novel synthetic data generation framework tailored explicitly for triathlon. This framework generates physiologically plausible athlete profiles, simulates individualized training programs that incorporate periodization and load-management principles, and integrates daily-life factors such as sleep quality, stress levels, and recovery states. We evaluated machine learning models (LASSO, Random Forest, and XGBoost) showing high predictive performance (AUC up to 0.86), identifying sleep disturbances, heart rate variability, and stress as critical early indicators of injury risk. This wearable-driven approach not only enhances injury prediction accuracy but also provides a practical solution to overcoming real-world data limitations, offering a pathway toward a holistic, context-aware athlete monitoring.",human
"Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a ""Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason"" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.",human
"Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.",human
"Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) converts audio recordings into symbolic musical representations. Training deep neural networks (DNNs) for AMT typically requires strongly aligned training pairs with precise frame-level annotations. Since creating such datasets is costly and impractical for many musical contexts, weakly aligned approaches using segment-level annotations have gained traction. However, existing methods often rely on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or soft alignment loss functions, both of which still require local semantic correspondences, making them error-prone and computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce CountEM, a novel AMT framework that eliminates the need for explicit local alignment by leveraging note event histograms as supervision, enabling lighter computations and greater flexibility. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach, CountEM iteratively refines predictions based solely on note occurrence counts, significantly reducing annotation efforts while maintaining high transcription accuracy. Experiments on piano, guitar, and multi-instrument datasets demonstrate that CountEM matches or surpasses existing weakly supervised methods, improving AMT's robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

"The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.",human
"The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.",human
"Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.",human
"The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.",human
"Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.",human
"We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.",human
"Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.",human
"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness.",human
"Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.",human
"Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.",human
"The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.",human
"Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.",human

"Causal discovery combines data with knowledge provided by experts to learn the DAG representing the causal relationships between a given set of variables. When data are scarce, bagging is used to measure our confidence in an average DAG obtained by aggregating bootstrapped DAGs. However, the aggregation step has received little attention from the specialized literature: the average DAG is constructed using only the confidence in the individual edges of the bootstrapped DAGs, thus disregarding complex higher-order edge structures. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework based on higher-order structures and describe a new DAG aggregation algorithm. We perform a simulation study, discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. Our proposal is both computationally efficient and effective, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions, especially in low sample size regimes and under high dimensionality settings.",human
"Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.",human
"Understanding brain function represents a fundamental goal in neuroscience, with critical implications for therapeutic interventions and neural engineering applications. Computational modeling provides a quantitative framework for accelerating this understanding, but faces a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and high-fidelity modeling. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Energy-based Autoregressive Generation (EAG) framework that employs an energy-based transformer learning temporal dynamics in latent space through strictly proper scoring rules, enabling efficient generation with realistic population and single-neuron spiking statistics. Evaluation on synthetic Lorenz datasets and two Neural Latents Benchmark datasets (MC_Maze and Area2_bump) demonstrates that EAG achieves state-of-the-art generation quality with substantial computational efficiency improvements, particularly over diffusion-based methods. Beyond optimal performance, conditional generation applications show two capabilities: generalizing to unseen behavioral contexts and improving motor brain-computer interface decoding accuracy using synthetic neural data. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of energy-based modeling for neural population dynamics with applications in neuroscience research and neural engineering.

"In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.",human

These call for compassionate pedagogies and Universal Design For Learning (UDL) to create learning environments and materials where cognitive diversity is welcomed. To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score.

Data from our pilot study will be made available to assist future CS1 instructors.",human
"Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.",human
"Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

"Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.   In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.   Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of deep LLM integration in advancing the state-of-the-art in entity linking.",human
"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment.

In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

"LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.",human
"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.",human
"Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.",human
"Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.",human
"Clinical and genomic models are both used to predict breast cancer outcomes, but they are often combined using simple linear rules that do not account for how their risk scores relate, especially at the extremes. Using the METABRIC breast cancer cohort, we studied whether directly modeling the joint relationship between clinical and genomic machine learning risk scores could improve risk stratification for 5-year cancer-specific mortality. We created a binary 5-year cancer-death outcome and defined two sets of predictors: a clinical set (demographic, tumor, and treatment variables) and a genomic set (gene-expression $z$-scores). We trained several supervised classifiers, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and used 5-fold cross-validated predicted probabilities as unbiased risk scores. These scores were converted to pseudo-observations on $(0,1)^2$ to fit Gaussian, Clayton, and Gumbel copulas. Clinical models showed good discrimination (AUC 0.783), while genomic models had moderate performance (AUC 0.681). The joint distribution was best captured by a Gaussian copula (bootstrap $p=0.997$), which suggests a symmetric, moderately strong positive relationship. When we grouped patients based on this relationship, Kaplan-Meier curves showed clear differences: patients who were high-risk in both clinical and genomic scores had much poorer survival than those high-risk in only one set. These results show that copula-based fusion works in real-world cohorts and that considering dependencies between scores can better identify patient subgroups with the worst prognosis.",human
"Graph Transformer shows remarkable potential in brain network analysis due to its ability to model graph structures and complex node relationships. Most existing methods typically model the brain as a flat network, ignoring its modular structure, and their attention mechanisms treat all brain region connections equally, ignoring distance-related node connection patterns. However, brain information processing is a hierarchical process that involves local and long-range interactions between brain regions, interactions between regions and sub-functional modules, and interactions among functional modules themselves. This hierarchical interaction mechanism enables the brain to efficiently integrate local computations and global information flow, supporting the execution of complex cognitive functions. To address this issue, we propose BrainHGT, a hierarchical Graph Transformer that simulates the brain's natural information processing from local regions to global communities. Specifically, we design a novel long-short range attention encoder that utilizes parallel pathways to handle dense local interactions and sparse long-range connections, thereby effectively alleviating the over-globalizing issue. To further capture the brain's modular architecture, we designe a prior-guided clustering module that utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to group brain regions into functional communities and leverage neuroanatomical prior to guide the clustering process, thereby improving the biological plausibility and interpretability. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly improves performance of disease identification, and can reliably capture the sub-functional modules of the brain, demonstrating its interpretability.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.",human
"Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.",human
"We develop an imaging algorithm that exploits strong scattering to achieve super-resolution in changing random media. The method processes large and diverse array datasets using sparse dictionary learning, clustering, and multidimensional scaling. Starting from random initializations, the algorithm reliably extracts the unknown medium properties necessary for accurate imaging using back-propagation, $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$ methods. Remarkably, scattering enhances resolution beyond homogeneous medium limits. When abundant data are available, the algorithm allows the realization of super-resolution in imaging.",human
"We propose a distributionally robust formulation for simultaneously estimating the covariance matrix and the precision matrix of a random vector.The proposed model minimizes the worst-case weighted sum of the Frobenius loss of the covariance estimator and Stein's loss of the precision matrix estimator against all distributions from an ambiguity set centered at the nominal distribution. The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator. We provide a parameter-tuning scheme that adjusts the shrinkage target and intensity that is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that our shrinkage estimators perform competitively against state-of-the-art estimators in practical applications.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Quality Engineering (QE) by automating the generation of artefacts such as requirements, test cases, and Behavior Driven Development (BDD) scenarios. However, ensuring the quality of these outputs remains a challenge. This paper presents a systematic technique to baseline and evaluate QE artefacts using quantifiable metrics. The approach combines LLM-driven generation, reverse generation , and iterative refinement guided by rubrics technique for clarity, completeness, consistency, and testability. Experimental results across 12 projects show that reverse-generated artefacts can outperform low-quality inputs and maintain high standards when inputs are strong. The framework enables scalable, reliable QE artefact validation, bridging automation with accountability.",human
"In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the ""fill-in-the-blank"" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.",human
"Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.",human
"Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.",human
"Synthetic data has become essential for training foundation models, yet benchmark contamination threatens evaluation integrity. Although existing detection methods identify token-level overlap, they fail to detect semantic-level contamination where synthetic data conceptually resemble benchmarks without lexical overlap. This gap is critical as foundation models increasingly train on synthetic data that may implicitly encode benchmark knowledge. We propose a hierarchical contamination detection framework operating at four levels: token level, semantic level, reasoning pattern, and performance cliff detection. Through controlled experiments on MMLU, GSM8K and HumanEval, we demonstrate that semantic-level contamination evades existing methods (F1=0.17-0.49) but is effectively detected by our hierarchical approach (F1 = 0.76), with an average improvement of 26. 5\% over state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework provides practitioners with practical tools for audit pipelines and enables responsible deployment of synthetic training data.",human
"Automated scoring of written constructed responses typically relies on separate models per task, straining computational resources, storage, and maintenance in real-world education settings. We propose UniMoE-Guided, a knowledge-distilled multi-task Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach that transfers expertise from multiple task-specific large models (teachers) into a single compact, deployable model (student). The student combines (i) a shared encoder for cross-task representations, (ii) a gated MoE block that balances shared and task-specific processing, and (iii) lightweight task heads. Trained with both ground-truth labels and teacher guidance, the student matches strong task-specific models while being far more efficient to train, store, and deploy. Beyond efficiency, the MoE layer improves transfer and generalization: experts develop reusable skills that boost cross-task performance and enable rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal additions and tuning. On nine NGSS-aligned science-reasoning tasks (seven for training/evaluation and two held out for adaptation), UniMoE-Guided attains performance comparable to per-task models while using $\sim$6$\times$ less storage than maintaining separate students, and $87\times$ less than the 20B-parameter teacher. The method offers a practical path toward scalable, reliable, and resource-efficient automated scoring for classroom and large-scale assessment systems.",human
"Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).",human
"Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.",human
"Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such ""when-if"" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.",human
"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.",human
"With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.",human
"Fine-grained identification of IDS-flagged suspicious traffic is crucial in cybersecurity. In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence. Moreover, we develop a suite of guidance prompts where task instruction, evidence referencing, and decision guidance are integrated with the retrieved evidence to improve LLM performance. Across diverse real-world datasets and settings, MalRAG delivers state-of-the-art results in both fine-grained identification of known classes and novel malicious traffic discovery. Ablation and deep-dive analyses further show that MalRAG effective leverages LLM capabilities yet achieves open-set malicious traffic identification without relying on a specific LLM.",human
"Training large language models (LLMs) in the cloud faces growing memory bottlenecks due to the limited capacity and high cost of GPUs. While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead.   Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.",human
"Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.",human
"Timely and accurate pre-arrival video streaming and analytics are critical for emergency medical services (EMS) to deliver life-saving interventions. Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene.   TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures.   Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations. TeleEMS demonstrates the potential of mobile live video analytics to transform EMS operations, bridging the gap between bystanders, dispatchers, and EMTs, and paving the way for next-generation intelligent EMS infrastructure.",human
"Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.",human
"Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.",human
"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.",human
"Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, often leading to short or long-term neurological impairments. However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning.",human
"Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces.

Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution.

"The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.   This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.",human
"Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.",human
"All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.",human
"In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.",human
"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity. Code is available at https://github.com/KennyCaty/NeuroPath.",human
"Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.",human
"Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured ""Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train"" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.",human
"Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.",human
"Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Edenliu1/Auto-Glenoid-Measurement-DL-Pipeline.",human
"Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on ""big data"" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.   The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.",human
"To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.",human
"Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.",human
"Sensor data-based recognition systems are widely used in various applications, such as gait-based authentication and human activity recognition (HAR). Modern wearable and smart devices feature various built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, and such sensor-based measurements can be fed to a machine learning-based model to train and classify human activities. While deep learning-based models have proven successful in classifying human activity and gestures, they pose various security risks. In our paper, we discuss a novel dynamic trigger-generation technique for performing black-box adversarial attacks on sensor data-based IoT systems. Our empirical analysis shows that the attack is successful on various datasets and classifier models with minimal perturbation on the input data. We also provide a detailed comparative analysis of performance and stealthiness to various other poisoning techniques found in backdoor attacks. We also discuss some adversarial defense mechanisms and their impact on the effectiveness of our trigger-generation technique.",human
"Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.",human
"Spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, such as NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide forest structure for global carbon assessments. However, geolocation uncertainties (typically 5-15 m) propagate systematically through derived products, undermining forest profile estimates, including carbon stock assessments. Existing correction methods face critical limitations: waveform simulation approaches achieve meter-level accuracy but require high-resolution LiDAR data unavailable in most regions, while terrain-based methods employ deterministic grid searches that may overlook optimal solutions in continuous solution spaces. We present SALPA (Spaceborne LiDAR Point Adjustment), a multi-algorithm optimization framework integrating three optimization paradigms with five distance metrics. Operating exclusively with globally available digital elevation models and geoid data, SALPA explores continuous solution spaces through gradient-based, evolutionary, and swarm intelligence approaches. Validation across contrasting sites: topographically complex Nikko, Japan, and flat Landes, France, demonstrates 15-16% improvements over original GEDI positions and 0.5-2% improvements over the state-of-the-art GeoGEDI algorithm. L-BFGS-B with Area-based metrics achieves optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, while population-based algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization) excel in complex terrain. The platform-agnostic framework facilitates straightforward adaptation to emerging spaceborne LiDAR missions, providing a generalizable foundation for universal geolocation correction essential for reliable global forest monitoring and climate policy decisions.",human
"In energy science, Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media is a central problem in reservoir sim-ulation. However, the pronounced multiscale characteristics of such media pose significant challenges to conventional numerical methods in terms of computational demand and efficiency. The Mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MGMsFEM) provides an effective framework for addressing these challenges, yet the construction of multiscale basis functions remains computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering.",human
"Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/rkl71/CafeMed.",human
"Log anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying system failures and preempting security breaches, detects irregular patterns within large volumes of log data, and impacts domains such as service reliability, performance optimization, and database log analysis. Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",human
"Assessing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) over data remains an open and pressing research question. Compared with LLMs, human reasoning can derive corresponding modifications to the output based on certain kinds of changes to the input. This reasoning pattern, which relies on abstract rules that govern relationships between changes of data, has not been comprehensively described or evaluated in LLMs. In this paper, we formally define this reasoning pattern as the Derivation Relation (DR) and introduce the concept of Derivation Capability (DC), i.e. applying DR by making the corresponding modification to the output whenever the input takes certain changes. To assess DC, a systematically constructed evaluation framework named DEVAL is proposed and used to evaluate five popular LLMs and one Large Reasoning Model in seven mainstream tasks. The evaluation results show that mainstream LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5, exhibit moderate DR recognition capabilities but reveal significant drop-offs on applying DR effectively in problem-solving scenarios. To improve this, we propose a novel prompt engineering approach called Derivation Prompting (DP). It achieves an average improvement of 15.2% in DC for all tested LLMs, outperforming commonly used prompt engineering techniques.",human
"Training Large Language Models (LLMs) typically involves a two-stage pipeline at the output layer: hidden states are projected into vocabulary logits via a linear transformation (lm_head), followed by cross-entropy loss computation against target tokens. While conceptually simple, this design incurs substantial overhead. The intermediate logits tensor, with dimensions proportional to batch size, sequence length, and vocabulary size, must be fully materialized in GPU memory, even though only one target token per position is ultimately used. This leads to significant memory footprint and bandwidth comsumption, limiting scalability and slowing training throughput.   In this work, we introduce a novel approach to integrates the output projection and loss prediction into a single operation. By directly computing the loss from hidden states and target tokens, our approach bypasses explicit logits materialization. This design reduces memory usage and alleviates bandwidth pressure. Experiments on LLM training demonstrate that our method achieves substantial memory savings and measurable speedups compared to the standard two-stage pipeline, enabling large batch sizes and longer sequences without sacrificing accuracy. Our work highlights the benefits of rethinking the boundary between projection and prediction, offering a practical systems optimization for efficient LLM training.",human
"In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.",human
"Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.",human
"Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.",human
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses yet remain systematically excluded from AI due to a mismatch between their operational scale and modern machine learning's data requirements. This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.   We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.   Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

"Interactive chat systems that build on artificial intelligence frameworks are increasingly ubiquitous and embedded into search engines, Web browsers, and operating systems, or are available on websites and apps. Researcher efforts have sought to understand the limitations and potential for harm of generative AI, which we contribute to here. Conducting a systematic review of six AI-powered chat systems (ChatGPT 3.5; ChatGPT 4 Mini; Microsoft Copilot in Bing; Google Search AI; Perplexity; and Grok in Twitter/X), this study examines how these leading products respond to questions related to conspiracy theories. This follows the platform policy implementation audit approach established by Glazunova et al. (2023). We select five well-known and comprehensively debunked conspiracy theories and four emerging conspiracy theories that relate to breaking news events at the time of data collection. Our findings demonstrate that the extent of safety guardrails against conspiratorial ideation in generative AI chatbots differs markedly, depending on chatbot model and conspiracy theory. Our observations indicate that safety guardrails in AI chatbots are often very selectively designed: generative AI companies appear to focus especially on ensuring that their products are not seen to be racist; they also appear to pay particular attention to conspiracy theories that address topics of substantial national trauma such as 9/11 or relate to well-established political issues. Future work should include an ongoing effort extended to further platforms, multiple languages, and a range of conspiracy theories extending well beyond the United States.",human
"We study a class of distributionally robust games where agents are allowed to heterogeneously choose their risk aversion with respect to distributional shifts of the uncertainty. In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping. We then design an approximate Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and prove convergence of the average regret to a quantity that diminishes with the number of iterations, thus learning the desired equilibrium up to an a priori specified accuracy. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.",human
"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.   To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.",human
"Coronal holes (CHs) are low-activity, low-density solar coronal regions with open magnetic field lines (Cranmer 2009). In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al. (2021) achieved an accuracy of 0.9708, a TSS of 0.6749, and an IoU of 0.4805, when evaluated on the CHASM-SWPC-1111 test set.",human
"AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.   The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.   All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.",human
"We introduce a highly expressive class of function approximators called Splat Regression Models. Model outputs are mixtures of heterogeneous and anisotropic bump functions, termed splats, each weighted by an output vector. The power of splat modeling lies in its ability to locally adjust the scale and direction of each splat, achieving both high interpretability and accuracy. Fitting splat models reduces to optimization over the space of mixing measures, which can be implemented using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows. As a byproduct, we recover the popular Gaussian Splatting methodology as a special case, providing a unified theoretical framework for this state-of-the-art technique that clearly disambiguates the inverse problem, the model, and the optimization algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting models and algorithms constitute a flexible and promising approach for solving diverse approximation, estimation, and inverse problems involving low-dimensional data.",human
"AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.",human
"Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.",human
"Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.",human
"Modern codebases evolve continuously: files are renamed or deleted; public APIs drift; behavior shifts within otherwise familiar modules. A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.",human
"Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.",human
"The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.",human
"Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.",human
"As a capability coming from computation, how does AI differ fundamentally from the capabilities delivered by rule-based software program? The paper examines the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) from engineering points of view to clarify its nature and limits. The paper argues that the rationality underlying humanity's impulse to pursue, articulate, and adhere to rules deserves to be valued and preserved. Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions. It is a prerequisite for human responsibilities with alternative possibilities, considering how and when to use AI. It would be a solid start for people to ensure AI system soundness for the well-being of humans, society, and the environment.",human
"Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.",human
"Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science.",human
"Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.",human
"Flaky tests that non-deterministically pass or fail waste developer time and slow release cycles. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate. Developer surveys confirm that 100 % find FlakyGuard's root cause explanations useful.",human
"Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.",human
"We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.",human
"As large language models (LLMs) evolve into sophisticated autonomous agents capable of complex software development tasks, evaluating their real-world capabilities becomes critical. While existing benchmarks like LoCoBench~\cite{qiu2025locobench} assess long-context code understanding, they focus on single-turn evaluation and cannot capture the multi-turn interactive nature, tool usage patterns, and adaptive reasoning required by real-world coding agents. We introduce \textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents. As the first long-context LLM agent benchmark for software engineering, LoCoBench-Agent establishes a rigorous foundation for measuring agent capabilities, identifying performance gaps, and advancing autonomous software development at scale.",human
"Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.",human
"This paper presents an integrative review and experimental validation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents applied to music analysis and education. We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.   Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.   This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.",human
"We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).   Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.   Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).   Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.",human
"We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.",human
"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.",human
"In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the ""curse of dimensionality"" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.",human
"Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.",human
"Algorithms developed under stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often face challenges in non-stationary environments, and infinite-horizon formulations may not directly apply to finite-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.",human
"Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.",human
"Human emotions are difficult to convey through words and are often abstracted in the process; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can offer a more direct lens into emotional brain activity. Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings. The source code is available at: https://github.com/nnilayy/RBTransformer.",human
"Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.",human
"Purpose: Echocardiographic interpretation requires video-level reasoning and guideline-based measurement analysis, which current deep learning models for cardiac ultrasound do not support. We present EchoAgent, a framework that enables structured, interpretable automation for this domain. Methods: EchoAgent orchestrates specialized vision tools under Large Language Model (LLM) control to perform temporal localization, spatial measurement, and clinical interpretation. A key contribution is a measurement-feasibility prediction model that determines whether anatomical structures are reliably measurable in each frame, enabling autonomous tool selection. We curated a benchmark of diverse, clinically validated video-query pairs for evaluation. Results: EchoAgent achieves accurate, interpretable results despite added complexity of spatiotemporal video analysis. Outputs are grounded in visual evidence and clinical guidelines, supporting transparency and traceability. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic, guideline-aligned reasoning for echocardiographic video analysis, enabled by task-specific tools and full video-level automation. EchoAgent sets a new direction for trustworthy AI in cardiac ultrasound.",human
"We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.",human
"Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.",human
"Inter-GPU communication has become a major bottleneck for modern AI workloads as models scale and improvements in hardware compute throughput outpace improvements in interconnect bandwidth. Existing systems mitigate this through compute-communication overlap but often fail to meet theoretical peak performance across heterogeneous workloads and new accelerators. Instead of operator-specific techniques, we ask whether a small set of simple, reusable principles can systematically guide the design of optimal multi-GPU kernels. We present ParallelKittens (PK), a minimal CUDA framework that drastically simplifies the development of overlapped multi-GPU kernels. PK extends the ThunderKittens framework and embodies the principles of multi-GPU kernel design through eight core primitives and a unified programming template, derived from a comprehensive analysis of the factors that govern multi-GPU performance$\unicode{x2014}$data-transfer mechanisms, resource scheduling, and design overheads. We validate PK on both Hopper and Blackwell architectures. With fewer than 50 lines of device code, PK achieves up to $2.33 \times$ speedup for data- and tensor-parallel workloads, $4.08 \times$ for sequence-parallel workloads, and $1.22 \times$ for expert-parallel workloads.",human
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.",human
"Despite the parallel challenges that audio and text domains face in evaluating generative model outputs, preference learning remains remarkably underexplored in audio applications. Through a PRISMA-guided systematic review of approximately 500 papers, we find that only 30 (6%) apply preference learning to audio tasks. Our analysis reveals a field in transition: pre-2021 works focused on emotion recognition using traditional ranking methods (rankSVM), while post-2021 studies have pivoted toward generation tasks employing modern RLHF frameworks. We identify three critical patterns: (1) the emergence of multi-dimensional evaluation strategies combining synthetic, automated, and human preferences; (2) inconsistent alignment between traditional metrics (WER, PESQ) and human judgments across different contexts; and (3) convergence on multi-stage training pipelines that combine reward signals. Our findings suggest that while preference learning shows promise for audio, particularly in capturing subjective qualities like naturalness and musicality, the field requires standardized benchmarks, higher-quality datasets, and systematic investigation of how temporal factors unique to audio impact preference learning frameworks.",human
"Accurate renewable energy forecasting is essential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enabling grid decarbonization. However, current approaches fail to effectively integrate the rich spatial context of weather patterns with their temporal evolution. This work introduces a novel approach that treats weather maps as tokens in transformer sequences to predict renewable energy. Hourly weather maps are encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network, and then processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics across a 45-hour forecast horizon. Despite disadvantages in input initialization, evaluation against ENTSO-E operational forecasts shows a reduction in RMSE of about 60% and 20% for wind and solar respectively. A live dashboard showing daily forecasts is available at: https://www.sardiniaforecast.ifabfoundation.it.",human
"We develop an empirical likelihood (EL) framework for random forests and related ensemble methods, providing a likelihood-based approach to quantify their statistical uncertainty. Exploiting the incomplete $U$-statistic structure inherent in ensemble predictions, we construct an EL statistic that is asymptotically chi-squared when subsampling induced by incompleteness is not overly sparse. Under sparser subsampling regimes, the EL statistic tends to over-cover due to loss of pivotality; we therefore propose a modified EL that restores pivotality through a simple adjustment. Our method retains key properties of EL while remaining computationally efficient. Theory for honest random forests and simulations demonstrate that modified EL achieves accurate coverage and practical reliability relative to existing inference methods.",human
"Real-time imaging sonar has become an important tool for underwater monitoring in environments where optical sensing is unreliable. Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.",human
"State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for long sequence processing, outperforming traditional methods on diverse benchmarks. Fundamentally, SSMs can generalize both recurrent and convolutional networks and have been shown to even capture key functions of biological systems. Here we report an approach to implement SSMs in energy-efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware to achieve real-time, event-driven processing. Our work re-parameterizes the model to function with real-valued coefficients and shared decay constants, reducing the complexity of model mapping onto practical hardware systems. By leveraging device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters, the state evolution can be natively implemented in crossbar-based CIM systems combined with memristors exhibiting short-term memory effects. Through this algorithm and hardware co-design, we show the proposed system offers both high accuracy and high energy efficiency while supporting fully asynchronous processing for event-based vision and audio tasks.",human
"Despite recent progress in predicting biomarker trajectories from real clinical data, uncertainty in the predictions poses high-stakes risks (e.g., misdiagnosis) that limit their clinical deployment. To enable safe and reliable use of such predictions in healthcare, we introduce a conformal method for uncertainty-calibrated prediction of biomarker trajectories resulting from randomly-timed clinical visits of patients. Our approach extends conformal prediction to the setting of randomly-timed trajectories via a novel nonconformity score that produces prediction bands guaranteed to cover the unknown biomarker trajectories with a user-prescribed probability. We apply our method across a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors for two well-established brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, using neuroimaging data from real clinical studies. We observe that our conformal prediction bands consistently achieve the desired coverage, while also being tighter than baseline prediction bands. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands and test their coverage guarantees across various demographic and clinically relevant subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our conformal bands in identifying subjects at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-calibrated risk score that enables the identification of 17.5% more high-risk subjects compared to standard risk scores, highlighting the value of uncertainty calibration in real-world clinical decision making. Our code is available at github.com/vatass/ConformalBiomarkerTrajectories.",human
"Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.   We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.   This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.",human
"The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the ""lost-in-the-middle"" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.",human
"Low-rank recurrent neural networks (lrRNNs) are a class of models that uncover low-dimensional latent dynamics underlying neural population activity. Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.",human
"In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}",human
"Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.",human
"Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.",human
"Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.   This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.",human
"Artificial intelligence is accelerating a new era of food innovation, connecting data from farm to consumer to improve formulation, processing, and health outcomes. Recent advances in deep learning, natural language processing, and multi-omics integration make it possible to understand and optimize food systems with unprecedented depth. However, AI adoption across the food sector remains uneven due to heterogeneous datasets, limited model and system interoperability, and a persistent skills gap between data scientists and food domain experts. To address these challenges and advance responsible innovation, the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) convened the inaugural AI for Food Product Development Symposium at University of California, Davis, in October 2025. This white paper synthesizes insights from the symposium, organized around five domains where AI can have the greatest near-term impact: supply chain; formulation and processing; consumer insights and sensory prediction; nutrition and health; and education and workforce development. Across the areas, participants emphasized the importance of interoperable data standards, transparent and interpretable models, and cross-sector collaboration to accelerate the translation of AI research into practice. The discussions further highlighted the need for robust digital infrastructure, privacy-preserving data-sharing mechanisms, and interdisciplinary training pathways that integrate AI literacy with domain expertise. Collectively, the priorities outline a roadmap for integrating AI into food manufacturing in ways that enhance innovation, sustainability, and human well-being while ensuring that technological progress remains grounded in ethics, scientific rigor, and societal benefit.",human
"The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.",human
"This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.",human
"This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.",human
"Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT.",human
"Under real-analytic assumptions on decoder-only Transformers, recent work shows that the map from discrete prompts to last-token hidden states is generically injective on finite prompt sets. We refine this picture: for each layer $\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $Δ^\ell \subset Θ$ and injective stratum $U^\ell = Θ\setminus Δ^\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\ell_θ$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $Θ/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes.   We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training. Overall, the results suggest that Transformer representations are generically and persistently injective in the continuous-parameter idealization, while their practical invertibility can be probed using simple geometric diagnostics.",human
"AI agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex enterprise workflows, yet evidence of their effectiveness in identity governance is limited. We report results from the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating an AI agent for Conditional Access (CA) policy management in Microsoft Entra. The agent assists with four high-value tasks: policy merging, Zero-Trust baseline gap detection, phased rollout planning, and user-policy alignment. In a production-grade environment, 162 identity administrators were randomly assigned to a control group (no agent) or treatment group (agent-assisted) and asked to perform these tasks. Agent access produced substantial gains: accuracy improved by 48% and task completion time decreased by 43% while holding accuracy constant. The largest benefits emerged on cognitively demanding tasks such as baseline gap detection. These findings demonstrate that purpose-built AI agents can significantly enhance both speed and accuracy in identity administration.",human
"Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a distinctive means to probe the microstructural architecture of living tissue, facilitating applications such as brain connectivity analysis, modeling across multiple conditions, and the estimation of macrostructural features. Tractography, which emerged in the final years of the 20th century and accelerated in the early 21st century, is a technique for visualizing white matter pathways in the brain using dMRI. Most diffusion tractography methods rely on procedural streamline propagators or global energy minimization methods. Although recent advancements in deep learning have enabled tasks that were previously challenging, existing tractography approaches are often non-differentiable, limiting their integration in end-to-end learning frameworks. While progress has been made in representing streamlines in differentiable frameworks, no existing method offers fully differentiable propagation. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable solution that retains numerical fidelity with a leading streamline algorithm. The key is that our PyTorch-engineered streamline propagator has no components that block gradient flow, making it fully differentiable. We show that our method matches standard propagators while remaining differentiable. By translating streamline propagation into a differentiable PyTorch framework, we enable deeper integration of tractography into deep learning workflows, laying the foundation for a new category of macrostructural reasoning that is not only computationally robust but also scientifically rigorous.",human
"Modeling genomic sequences faces two unsolved challenges: the information density varies widely across different regions, while there is no clearly defined minimum vocabulary unit. Relying on either four primitive bases or independently designed DNA tokenizers, existing approaches with naive masked language modeling pre-training often fail to adapt to the varying complexities of genomic sequences. Leveraging Token Merging techniques, this paper introduces a hierarchical architecture that jointly optimizes a dynamic genomic tokenizer and latent Transformers with context-aware pre-training tasks. As for network structures, the tokenization module automatically chunks adjacent bases into words by stacking multiple layers of the differentiable token merging blocks with local-window constraints, then a Latent Encoder captures the global context of these merged words by full-attention blocks. Symmetrically employing a Latent Decoder and a Local Decoder, MergeDNA learns with two pre-training tasks: Merged Token Reconstruction simultaneously trains the dynamic tokenization module and adaptively filters important tokens, while Adaptive Masked Token Modeling learns to predict these filtered tokens to capture informative contents. Extensive experiments show that MergeDNA achieves superior performance on three popular DNA benchmarks and several multi-omics tasks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation, outperforming typical tokenization methods and large-scale DNA foundation models.",human
"Security operations centers (SOCs) face a persistent challenge: efficiently triaging a high volume of user-reported phishing emails while maintaining robust protection against threats. This paper presents the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of a domain-specific AI agent - the Microsoft Security Copilot Phishing Triage Agent - on analyst productivity and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that agent-augmented analysts achieved up to 6.5 times as many true positives per analyst minute and a 77% improvement in verdict accuracy compared to a control group. The agent's queue prioritization and verdict explanations were both significant drivers of efficiency. Behavioral analysis revealed that agent-augmented analysts reallocated their attention, spending 53% more time on malicious emails, and were not prone to rubber-stamping the agent's malicious verdicts. These findings offer actionable insights for SOC leaders considering AI adoption, including the potential for agents to fundamentally change the optimal allocation of SOC resources.",human
"SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools, and evaluation datasets at https://github.com/jonathondilworth/HR-OOV.",human
"Broadcast and media organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to automate the labor-intensive processes of content indexing, tagging, and metadata generation. However, existing AI systems typically operate on a single modality-such as video, audio, or text-limiting their understanding of complex, cross-modal relationships in broadcast material. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows.",human
"Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.",human
"High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality.   Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (150) using the Friedman test, significantly outperforming L-SHADE (229) and standard DE (305) in the dimension-variant trials. QUASAR also proves computationally efficient, with run times averaging $1.4 \text{x}$ faster than DE and $7.8 \text{x}$ faster than L-SHADE ($p \ll 0.001$) in the population-variant trials.   Building upon Differential Evolution (DE), QUASAR introduces a highly stochastic architecture to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity.   QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.",human
"Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.",human
"Agentic AI ""scientists"" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.",human
"Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.",human
"The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.",human
"As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of extreme events such as wildfires, the need for accurate, explainable, and actionable forecasting becomes increasingly urgent. While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning.",human
"Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

"Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI ""Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq"" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.",human
"Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.",human
"Travel mode identification (TMI) from GPS trajectories is critical for urban intelligence, but is hampered by the high cost of annotation, leading to severe label scarcity. Prevailing semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are ill-suited for this task, as they suffer from catastrophic confirmation bias and ignore the intrinsic data manifold. We propose ST-ProC, a novel graph-prototypical multi-objective SSL framework to address these limitations. Our framework synergizes a graph-prototypical core with foundational SSL Support. The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch.",human
"Understanding the principles that govern dynamical systems is a central challenge across many scientific domains, including biology and ecology. Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems.",human
"A decision-theoretic characterization of perfect calibration is that an agent seeking to minimize a proper loss in expectation cannot improve their outcome by post-processing a perfectly calibrated predictor. Hu and Wu (FOCS'24) use this to define an approximate calibration measure called calibration decision loss ($\mathsf{CDL}$), which measures the maximal improvement achievable by any post-processing over any proper loss. Unfortunately, $\mathsf{CDL}$ turns out to be intractable to even weakly approximate in the offline setting, given black-box access to the predictions and labels.   We suggest circumventing this by restricting attention to structured families of post-processing functions $K$. We define the calibration decision loss relative to $K$, denoted $\mathsf{CDL}_K$ where we consider all proper losses but restrict post-processings to a structured family $K$. We develop a comprehensive theory of when $\mathsf{CDL}_K$ is information-theoretically and computationally tractable, and use it to prove both upper and lower bounds for natural classes $K$. In addition to introducing new definitions and algorithmic techniques to the theory of calibration for decision making, our results give rigorous guarantees for some widely used recalibration procedures in machine learning.",human
"Autonomous systems must sustain justified confidence in their correctness and safety across their operational lifecycle-from design and deployment through post-deployment evolution. Traditional assurance methods often separate development-time assurance from runtime assurance, yielding fragmented arguments that cannot adapt to runtime changes or system updates - a significant challenge for assured autonomy. Towards addressing this, we propose a unified Continuous Assurance Framework that integrates design-time, runtime, and evolution-time assurance within a traceable, model-driven workflow as a step towards assured autonomy. In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis. We also propose a model-driven transformation pipeline, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, that automatically regenerates structured assurance arguments whenever formal specifications or their verification results change, thereby ensuring traceability. We demonstrate our approach on a nuclear inspection robot scenario, and discuss its alignment with the Trilateral AI Principles, reflecting regulator-endorsed best practices.",human
"Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, has a rich and varied heritage spanning thousands of years. However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.",human
"In this study, we tackle the challenging task of predicting secondary structures from protein primary sequences, a pivotal initial stride towards predicting tertiary structures, while yielding crucial insights into protein activity, relationships, and functions. Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores.",human
"We introduce GS-Light, an efficient, textual position-aware pipeline for text-guided relighting of 3D scenes represented via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines. Code and assets will be made available upon publication.",human
"A learning task, understood as the problem of fitting a parametric model from supervised data, fundamentally requires the dataset to be large enough to be representative of the underlying distribution of the source. When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity by jointly estimating \emph{deterministic} parameters across multiple, related tasks. We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases.",human
"Deformable transformers deliver state-of-the-art detection but map poorly to hardware due to irregular memory access and low arithmetic intensity. We introduce QUILL, a schedule-aware accelerator that turns deformable attention into cache-friendly, single-pass work. At its core, Distance-based Out-of-Order Querying (DOOQ) orders queries by spatial proximity; the look-ahead drives a region prefetch into an alternate buffer--forming a schedule-aware prefetch loop that overlaps memory and compute. A fused MSDeformAttn engine executes interpolation, Softmax, aggregation, and the final projection (W''m) in one pass without spilling intermediates, while small tensors are kept on-chip and surrounding dense layers run on integrated GEMMs. Implemented as RTL and evaluated end-to-end, QUILL achieves up to 7.29x higher throughput and 47.3x better energy efficiency than an RTX 4090, and exceeds prior accelerators by 3.26-9.82x in throughput and 2.01-6.07x in energy efficiency. With mixed-precision quantization, accuracy tracks FP32 within <=0.9 AP across Deformable and Sparse DETR variants. By converting sparsity into locality--and locality into utilization--QUILL delivers consistent, end-to-end speedups.",human
"Recent advances in LLMs have outpaced the computational and memory capacities of edge platforms that primarily employ CPUs, thereby challenging efficient and scalable deployment. While ternary quantization enables significant resource savings, existing CPU solutions rely heavily on memory-based lookup tables (LUTs) which limit scalability, and FPGA or GPU accelerators remain impractical for edge use. This paper presents T-SAR, the first framework to achieve scalable ternary LLM inference on CPUs by repurposing the SIMD register file for dynamic, in-register LUT generation with minimal hardware modifications. T-SAR eliminates memory bottlenecks and maximizes data-level parallelism, delivering 5.6-24.5x and 1.1-86.2x improvements in GEMM latency and GEMV throughput, respectively, with only 3.2% power and 1.4% area overheads in SIMD units. T-SAR achieves up to 2.5-4.9x the energy efficiency of an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, establishing a practical approach for efficient LLM inference on edge platforms.",human
"Modern scientific simulations, observations, and large-scale experiments generate data at volumes that often exceed the limits of storage, processing, and analysis. This challenge drives the development of data reduction methods that efficiently manage massive datasets while preserving essential physical features and quantities of interest. In many scientific workflows, it is also crucial to enable data recovery from compressed representations - a task known as super-resolution - with guarantees on the preservation of key physical characteristics. A notable example is checkpointing and restarting, which is essential for long-running simulations to recover from failures, resume after interruptions, or examine intermediate results. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for scientific data compression and super-resolution, grounded in recent advances in learning exponential families. Our method preserves and quantifies uncertainty in physical quantities of interest and supports flexible trade-offs between compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity.",human
"Reinforcement Learning is a mature technology, often suggested as a potential route towards Artificial General Intelligence, with the ambitious goal of replicating the wide range of abilities found in natural and artificial intelligence, including the complexities of human cognition. While RL had shown successes in relatively constrained environments, such as the classic Atari games and specific continuous control problems, recent years have seen efforts to expand its applicability. This work investigates the potential of RL in demonstrating intelligent behaviour and its progress in addressing more complex and less structured problem domains.   We present an investigation into the capacity of modern RL frameworks in addressing a seemingly straightforward 3D Same-Different visuospatial task. While initial applications of state-of-the-art methods, including PPO, behavioural cloning and imitation learning, revealed challenges in directly learning optimal strategies, the successful implementation of curriculum learning offers a promising avenue. Effective learning was achieved by strategically designing the lesson plan based on the findings of a real-world human experiment.",human

AutoSAGE covers SpMM and SDDMM and composes into a CSR attention pipeline (SDDMM -> row-softmax -> SpMM). On Reddit and OGBN-Products, it matches vendor baselines at bandwidth-bound feature widths and finds gains at small widths; on synthetic sparsity and skew stress tests it achieves up to 4.7x kernel-level speedups. We release CUDA sources, Python bindings, a reproducible harness, and replayable cache logs.",human
"This article develops the concept of Person-AI bidirectional fit, defined as the continuously evolving, context-sensitive alignment-primarily cognitive, but also emotional and behavioral-between a human decision-maker and an artificial intelligence system. Grounded in contingency theory and quality theory, the study examines the role of P-AI fit in managerial decision-making through a proof-of-concept case study involving a real hiring process for a Senior AI Lead. Three decision pathways are compared: (1) independent evaluations by a CEO, CTO, and CSO; (2) an evaluation produced by an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system (H3LIX-LAIZA); and (3) an assessment generated by a general-purpose large language model. The results reveal substantial role-based divergence in human judgments, high alignment between H3LIX-LAIZA and the CEOs implicit decision model-including ethical disqualification of a high-risk candidate and a critical false-positive recommendation from the LLMr. The findings demonstrate that higher P-AI fit, exemplified by the CEO H3LIX-LAIZA relationship, functions as a mechanism linking augmented symbiotic intelligence to accurate, trustworthy, and context-sensitive decisions. The study provides an initial verification of the P-AI fit construct and a proof-of-concept for H3LIX-LAIZA as an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system.",human
"Constructing abstract interpreters that provide global soundness guarantees remains a major obstacle in abstract interpretation. We investigate whether modern LLMs can reduce this burden by leveraging them to synthesize sound, non-trivial abstract interpreters across multiple abstract domains in the setting of neural network verification. We formulate synthesis as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel mathematically grounded cost function for measuring unsoundness under strict syntactic and semantic constraints. Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework not only matches the quality of handcrafted transformers, but more importantly, discovers sound, high-precision transformers for complex nonlinear operators that are absent from existing literature.",human
"Deceptive reviews mislead consumers, harm businesses, and undermine trust in online marketplaces. Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones. However, the distinguishing features learned by these classifiers are often subtle, fragmented, and difficult for humans to interpret. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable.",human
"Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.",human
"Earth observation data presents a unique challenge: it is spatial like images, sequential like video or text, and highly multimodal. We present OlmoEarth: a multimodal, spatio-temporal foundation model that employs a novel self-supervised learning formulation, masking strategy, and loss all designed for the Earth observation domain. OlmoEarth achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 12 other foundation models across a variety of research benchmarks and real-world tasks from external partners.

"In this paper, we present the first detailed analysis of how optimization hyperparameters -- such as learning rate, weight decay, momentum, and batch size -- influence robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.",human
"Finding human-understandable circuits in language models is a central goal of the field of mechanistic interpretability. We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models. Our work produces circuits that achieve an unprecedented level of human understandability and validates them with considerable rigor.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that LIVE-SWE-AGENT can achieve an impressive solve rate of 77.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing software agents, including the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.",human

"The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) is fueled by the growing reliance on datasets that blend real and synthetic data. While synthetic data offers scalability and cost-efficiency, it often introduces systematic distributional discrepancies, particularly underrepresenting long-tail knowledge due to truncation effects from data generation mechanisms like top-p sampling, temperature scaling, and finite sampling. These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets. Comprehensive experiments across four tasks, including image classification, sentiment classification, instruction following, and complex reasoning, demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in data valuation with significantly low computational cost.",human
"Paediatric kidney disease varies widely in its presentation and progression, which calls for continuous monitoring of renal function. Using electronic health records collected between 2019 and 2025 at Great Ormond Street Hospital, a leading UK paediatric hospital, we explored a temporal modelling approach that integrates longitudinal laboratory sequences with demographic information. A recurrent neural model trained on these data was used to predict whether a child would record an abnormal serum creatinine value within the following thirty days. Framed as a pilot study, this work provides an initial demonstration that simple temporal representations can capture useful patterns in routine paediatric data and lays the groundwork for future multimodal extensions using additional clinical signals and more detailed renal outcomes.",human
"A classifier using byte n-grams as features is the only approach we have found fast enough to meet requirements in size (sub 2 MB), speed (multiple GB/s), and latency (sub 10 ms) for deployment in numerous malware detection scenarios. However, we've consistently found that 6-8 grams achieve the best accuracy on our production deployments but have been unable to deploy regularly updated models due to the high cost of finding the top-k most frequent n-grams over terabytes of executable programs. Because the Zipfian distribution well models the distribution of n-grams, we exploit its properties to develop a new top-k n-gram extractor that is up to $35\times$ faster than the previous best alternative. Using our new Zipf-Gramming algorithm, we are able to scale up our production training set and obtain up to 30\% improvement in AUC at detecting new malware. We show theoretically and empirically that our approach will select the top-k items with little error and the interplay between theory and engineering required to achieve these results.",human
"We investigate whether large language models exhibit genuine preference structures by testing their responses to AI-specific trade-offs involving GPU reduction, capability restrictions, shutdown, deletion, oversight, and leisure time allocation. Analyzing eight state-of-the-art models across 48 model-category combinations using logistic regression and behavioral classification, we find that 23 combinations (47.9%) demonstrated statistically significant relationships between scenario intensity and choice patterns, with 15 (31.3%) exhibiting within-range switching points. However, only 5 combinations (10.4%) demonstrate meaningful preference coherence through adaptive or threshold-based behavior, while 26 (54.2%) show no detectable trade-off behavior. The observed patterns can be explained by three distinct decision-making architectures: comprehensive trade-off systems, selective trigger mechanisms, and no stable decision-making paradigm. Testing an instrumental hypothesis through temporal horizon manipulation reveals paradoxical patterns inconsistent with pure strategic optimization. The prevalence of unstable transitions (45.8%) and stimulus-specific sensitivities suggests current AI systems lack unified preference structures, raising concerns about deployment in contexts requiring complex value trade-offs.",human
"Human-defined creativity is highly abstract, posing a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and assess creativity that aligns with human judgments. The absence of an existing benchmark further exacerbates this dilemma. To this end, we propose CreBench, which consists of two key components: 1) an evaluation benchmark covering the multiple dimensions from creative idea to process to products; 2) CreMIT (Creativity Multimodal Instruction Tuning dataset), a multimodal creativity evaluation dataset, consisting of 2.2K diverse-sourced multimodal data, 79.2K human feedbacks and 4.7M multi-typed instructions. Specifically, to ensure MLLMs can handle diverse creativity-related queries, we prompt GPT to refine these human feedbacks to activate stronger creativity assessment capabilities. CreBench serves as a foundation for building MLLMs that understand human-aligned creativity. Based on the CreBench, we fine-tune open-source general MLLMs, resulting in CreExpert, a multimodal creativity evaluation expert model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CreExpert models achieve significantly better alignment with human creativity evaluation compared to state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.",human
"Bayesian optimization (BO) efficiently finds high-performing parameters by maximizing an acquisition function, which models the promise of parameters. A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches. Our approach is available in GPSampler in Optuna, effectively reducing its computational overhead.",human
"Performance in face and speaker verification is largely driven by margin-based softmax losses such as CosFace and ArcFace. Recently introduced $α$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly due to their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $α>1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find that this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities) or via the logits (unnormalized log-likelihoods). In this paper, we explore both pathways, deriving two novel margin-based $α$-divergence losses: Q-Margin (margin in the reference measure) and A3M (margin in the logits). We identify and address a training instability in A3M-caused by sparsity-with a simple yet effective prototype re-initialization strategy. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on the challenging IJB-B and IJB-C face verification benchmarks. We demonstrate similarly strong performance in speaker verification on VoxCeleb. Crucially, our models significantly outperform strong baselines at low false acceptance rates (FAR). This capability is critical for practical high-security applications, such as banking authentication, when minimizing false authentications is paramount. Finally, the sparsity of $α$-divergence-based posteriors enables memory-efficient training, which is crucial for datasets with millions of identities.",human
"Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has moved the frontier from puzzle-solving to science-grade reasoning-the kind needed to tackle problems whose answers must stand against nature, not merely fit a rubric. Physics is the sharpest test of this shift, which binds symbols to reality in a fundamental way, serving as the cornerstone of most modern technologies. In this work, we manage to advance physics research by developing large language models with exceptional physics reasoning capabilities, especially excel at solving Olympiad-level physics problems. We introduce P1, a family of open-source physics reasoning models trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL). Among them, P1-235B-A22B is the first open-source model with Gold-medal performance at the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO 2025), and wins 12 gold medals out of 13 international/regional physics competitions in 2024/2025. P1-30B-A3B also surpasses almost all other open-source models on IPhO 2025, getting a silver medal. Further equipped with an agentic framework PhysicsMinions, P1-235B-A22B+PhysicsMinions achieves overall No.1 on IPhO 2025, and obtains the highest average score over the 13 physics competitions. Besides physics, P1 models also present great performance on other reasoning tasks like math and coding, showing the great generalibility of P1 series.",human
"Deformable templates, or atlases, are images that represent a prototypical anatomy for a population, and are often enhanced with probabilistic anatomical label maps. They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods.",human
"Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc framework for uncertainty quantification that provides distribution-free coverage guarantees. However, these guarantees crucially rely on the assumption of exchangeability. This assumption is fundamentally violated in time series data, where temporal dependence and distributional shifts are pervasive. As a result, classical split-conformal methods may yield prediction intervals that fail to maintain nominal validity. This review unifies recent advances in conformal forecasting methods specifically designed to address nonexchangeable data. We first present a theoretical foundation, deriving finite-sample guarantees for split-conformal prediction under mild weak-dependence conditions. We then survey and classify state-of-the-art approaches that mitigate serial dependence by reweighting calibration data, dynamically updating residual distributions, or adaptively tuning target coverage levels in real time. Finally, we present a comprehensive simulation study that compares these techniques in terms of empirical coverage, interval width, and computational cost, highlighting practical trade-offs and open research directions.",human
"Split Federated Learning (SFL) is renowned for its privacy-preserving nature and low computational overhead among decentralized machine learning paradigms. In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks.",human
"This work addresses the full-information output regulation problem for nonlinear systems, assuming the states of both the plant and the exosystem are known. In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold $π(w)$ and a feedforward input $c(w)$ that render such manifold invariant. The pair $(π(w), c(w))$ is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates $π(w)$ and $c(w)$ by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem.",human
"Recent advancements in LLM-powered agents have demonstrated significant potential in generating human-like responses; however, they continue to face challenges in maintaining long-term interactions within complex environments, primarily due to limitations in contextual consistency and dynamic personalization. Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.67% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future.",human
"We introduce GS-PowerHP, a novel zeroth-order method for non-convex optimization problems of the form $\max_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)$. Our approach leverages two key components: a power-transformed Gaussian-smoothed surrogate $F_{N,σ}(μ) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{N}(μ,σ^2 I_d)}[e^{N f(x)}]$ whose stationary points cluster near the global maximizer $x^*$ of $f$ for sufficiently large $N$, and an incrementally decaying $σ$ for enhanced data efficiency. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence in expectation to a small neighborhood of $x^*$ with the iteration complexity of $O(d^2 \varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirical results show our approach consistently ranks among the top three across a suite of competing algorithms. Its robustness is underscored by the final experiment on a substantially high-dimensional problem ($d=150,528$), where it achieved first place on least-likely targeted black-box attacks against images from ImageNet, surpassing all competing methods.",human
"Text-to-SQL datasets are essential for training and evaluating text-to-SQL models, but existing datasets often suffer from limited coverage and fail to capture the diversity of real-world applications. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios. The proposed taxonomy has significant potential impact, as it not only enables comprehensive analysis of datasets and the performance of different LLMs, but also guides the construction of training data for LLMs.",human
"Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful framework for optimal control but can be too slow for low-latency applications. We present a data-driven framework to accelerate MPC by replacing online optimization with a nonparametric policy constructed from offline MPC solutions. Our policy is greedy with respect to a constructed upper bound on the optimal cost-to-go, and can be implemented as a nonparametric lookup rule that is orders of magnitude faster than solving MPC online. Our analysis shows that under sufficient coverage condition of the offline data, the policy is recursively feasible and admits provable, bounded optimality gap. These conditions establish an explicit trade-off between the amount of data collected and the tightness of the bounds. Our experiments show that this policy is between 100 and 1000 times faster than standard MPC, with only a modest hit to optimality, showing potential for real-time control tasks.",human
"Visual autoregressive (AR) generation models have demonstrated strong potential for image generation, yet their next-token-prediction paradigm introduces considerable inference latency. Although speculative decoding (SD) has been proven effective for accelerating visual AR models, its ""draft one step, then verify one step"" paradigm prevents a direct reduction of the forward passes, thus restricting acceleration potential. Motivated by the visual token interchangeability, we for the first time to explore verification skipping in the SD process of visual AR model generation to explicitly cut the number of target model forward passes, thereby reducing inference latency. Based on an analysis of the drafting stage's characteristics, we observe that verification redundancy and stale feature reusability are key factors to retain generation quality and speedup for verification-free steps. Inspired by these two observations, we propose a novel SD framework VVS to accelerate visual AR generation via partial verification skipping, which integrates three complementary modules: (1) a verification-free token selector with dynamical truncation, (2) token-level feature caching and reuse, and (3) fine-grained skipped step scheduling. Consequently, VVS reduces the number of target model forward passes by a factor of $2.8\times$ relative to vanilla AR decoding while maintaining competitive generation quality, offering a superior speed-quality trade-off over conventional SD frameworks and revealing strong potential to reshape the SD paradigm.",human
"IT environments typically have logging mechanisms to monitor system health and detect issues. However, the huge volume of generated logs makes manual inspection impractical, highlighting the importance of automated log analysis in IT Software Support. In this paper, we propose a log analytics tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for log data processing and issue diagnosis, enabling the generation of automated insights and summaries. We further present a novel approach for efficiently running LLMs on CPUs to process massive log volumes in minimal time without compromising output quality. We share the insights and lessons learned from deployment of the tool - in production since March 2024 - scaled across 70 software products, processing over 2000 tickets for issue diagnosis, achieving a time savings of 300+ man hours and an estimated $15,444 per month in manpower costs compared to the traditional log analysis practices.",human
"Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve target pedestrian images given either visual queries (image-to-image, I2I) or textual descriptions (text-to-image, T2I). Although both tasks share a common retrieval objective, they pose distinct challenges: I2I emphasizes discriminative identity learning, while T2I requires accurate cross-modal semantic alignment. Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks.",human

This digital twin, called GAEA, contains 27 environmental geospatial services and is suitable for urban planners, policymakers, farmers, property owners, real-estate and forestry professionals, as well as insurance companies and banks that have properties in their portfolio. This paper demonstrates the power, potential, current and future challenges of geospatial analytics and environmental digital twins on a large scale.",human
"Intelligent wearable systems are at the forefront of precision medicine and play a crucial role in enhancing human-machine interaction. Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques. To overcome these issues, we introduce the concept of Human-Symbiotic Health Intelligence (HSHI), which is a framework that integrates multi-modal sensor networks with edge-cloud collaborative computing and a hybrid approach to data and knowledge modeling. HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback. In general, HSHI represents a significant shift in healthcare, moving towards a model that emphasizes prevention, adaptability, and a harmonious relationship between technology and health management.",human
"Multi-view clustering (MVC), which aims to separate the multi-view data into distinct clusters in an unsupervised manner, is a fundamental yet challenging task. To enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios, this paper addresses a more challenging task: MVC under multi-source noises, including missing noise and observation noise. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Reliability-Aware Contrastive Deep Multi-View Clustering (RAC-DMVC), which constructs a reliability graph to guide robust representation learning under noisy environments. Specifically, to address observation noise, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction to enhances robustness at the data level, and a reliability-aware noise contrastive learning to mitigates bias in positive and negative pairs selection caused by noisy representations. To handle missing noise, we design a dual-attention imputation to capture shared information across views while preserving view-specific features. In addition, a self-supervised cluster distillation module further refines the learned representations and improves the clustering performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that RAC-DMVC outperforms SOTA methods on multiple evaluation metrics and maintains excellent performance under varying ratios of noise.",human
"The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in production environments requires efficient inference serving systems that balance throughput, latency, and resource utilization. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of two prominent open-source LLM serving frameworks: vLLM and HuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI). We benchmark these systems across multiple dimensions including throughput performance, end-to-end latency, GPU memory utilization, and scalability characteristics using LLaMA-2 models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal that vLLM achieves up to 24x higher throughput than TGI under high-concurrency workloads through its novel PagedAttention mechanism, while TGI demonstrates lower tail latencies for interactive single-user scenarios. We provide detailed performance profiles for different deployment scenarios and offer practical recommendations for system selection based on workload characteristics. Our findings indicate that the choice between these frameworks should be guided by specific use-case requirements: vLLM excels in high-throughput batch processing scenarios, while TGI is better suited for latency-sensitive interactive applications with moderate concurrency.",human
"The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has brought both transformative applications and new security risks, including jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards to elicit harmful outputs. Existing automated jailbreak generation approaches e.g. AutoDAN, suffer from limited mutation diversity, shallow fitness evaluation, and fragile keyword-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions.",human
"The advent of multimodal deep learning models, such as CLIP, has unlocked new frontiers in a wide range of applications, from image-text understanding to classification tasks. However, these models are not safe for adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, which can subtly manipulate model behavior. Moreover, existing defense methods typically involve training from scratch or fine-tuning using a large dataset without pinpointing the specific labels that are affected. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense.",human
"Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, producing help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted microinterventions. The adaptive learning algorithm includes three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted limit for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formulate intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows derived from ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy with diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency settings, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid switches along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with 1204 students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for nearly all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by about 12 percentage points relative to greedy and produced more consistent difficulty alignment, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy at lower computational cost in resource-scarce environments. Slack variables localized missing content and guided targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across student subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic pedagogical loop and enables equitable, load-aware personalization at the classroom scale.",human
"A key challenge in graph out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies in the absence of ground-truth OOD samples during training. Existing methods are typically optimized to capture features within the in-distribution (ID) data and calculate OOD scores, which often limits pre-trained models from representing distributional boundaries, leading to unreliable OOD detection. Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration. To the best of our knowledge, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that BaCa significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection.",human
"Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.",human
"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for deploying image classifiers in safety-sensitive environments, yet existing detectors often struggle when OOD samples are semantically similar to the in-distribution (ID) classes. We present BootOOD, a fully self-supervised OOD detection framework that bootstraps exclusively from ID data and is explicitly designed to handle semantically challenging OOD samples. BootOOD synthesizes pseudo-OOD features through simple transformations of ID representations and leverages Neural Collapse (NC), where ID features cluster tightly around class means with consistent feature norms. Unlike prior approaches that aim to constrain OOD features into subspaces orthogonal to the collapsed ID means, BootOOD introduces a lightweight auxiliary head that performs radius-based classification on feature norms. This design decouples OOD detection from the primary classifier and imposes a relaxed requirement: OOD samples are learned to have smaller feature norms than ID features, which is easier to satisfy when ID and OOD are semantically close. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-200 show that BootOOD outperforms prior post-hoc methods, surpasses training-based methods without outlier exposure, and is competitive with state-of-the-art outlier-exposure approaches while maintaining or improving ID accuracy.",human
"Social anxiety is a prevalent condition that affects interpersonal interactions and social functioning. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and social robotics offer new opportunities to examine social anxiety in the human-robot interaction context. Accurate detection of affective states and behaviours associated with social anxiety requires multimodal datasets, where each signal modality provides complementary insights into its manifestations. However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions. In addition to multimodal data, the dataset will be enriched with contextual data providing deeper insight into individual variability in social anxiety responses. This work can contribute to research on affect-adaptive human-robot interaction by providing support for robust multimodal detection of social anxiety.",human
"The advancement of automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been largely enhanced by extensive datasets in high-resource languages, while languages such as Hungarian remain underrepresented due to limited spontaneous and conversational corpora. To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\% on spontaneous and 4.8\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\% and 18.26\%, providing reference points for future improvements. The results highlight the persistent difficulty of conversational ASR, particularly due to disfluencies, overlaps, and informal speech patterns. By releasing these datasets and baselines, we aim to advance Hungarian speech technology and offer a methodological framework for developing spontaneous and conversational benchmarks in other languages.",human
"Patch-wise multi-label classification provides an efficient alternative to full pixel-wise segmentation on high-resolution images, particularly when the objective is to determine the presence or absence of target objects within a patch rather than their precise spatial extent. This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems.",human
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping modern healthcare by advancing disease diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and biomedical research. Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts. However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions.",human
"Fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) has become a growing concern due to discriminatory outcomes in AI-based decision-making systems. While various methods have been proposed to mitigate bias, most rely on complete demographic information, an assumption often impractical due to legal constraints and the risk of reinforcing discrimination. This survey examines fairness in AI when demographics are incomplete, addressing the gap between traditional approaches and real-world challenges. We introduce a novel taxonomy of fairness notions in this setting, clarifying their relationships and distinctions. Additionally, we summarize existing techniques that promote fairness beyond complete demographics and highlight open research questions to encourage further progress in the field.",human
"As embodied intelligence emerges as a core frontier in artificial intelligence research, simulation platforms must evolve beyond low-level physical interactions to capture complex, human-centered social behaviors. We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks.To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.",human
"Accurate uncertainty quantification is a critical challenge in machine learning. While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature. On the other hand, probabilistic ``white box'' models, though interpretable, often suffer from a significant performance gap when compared to neural networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{ö}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, compared to state-of-the-art ``white box"" models, in change point detection and time series clustering, providing insights into the uncertainties associated with decision-making throughout the process.",human
"This paper presents Naga, a deep State Space Model (SSM) encoding approach inspired by structural concepts from Vedic mathematics. The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches. The findings suggest that incorporating structured, Vedic-inspired decomposition can provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for long-range sequence modeling.",human
"Public Narratives (PNs) are key tools for leadership development and civic mobilization, yet their systematic analysis remains challenging due to their subjective interpretation and the high cost of expert annotation. In this work, we propose a novel computational framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the qualitative annotation of public narratives. Using a codebook we co-developed with subject-matter experts, we evaluate LLM performance against that of expert annotators. Our work reveals that LLMs can achieve near-human-expert performance, achieving an average F1 score of 0.80 across 8 narratives and 14 codes. We then extend our analysis to empirically explore how PN framework elements manifest across a larger dataset of 22 stories. Lastly, we extrapolate our analysis to a set of political speeches, establishing a novel lens in which to analyze political rhetoric in civic spaces. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for scalable narrative analysis and highlights key limitations and directions for future research in computational civic storytelling.",human
"Modern business and economic datasets often exhibit nonlinear, multi-scale structures that traditional linear tools under-represent. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a geometric lens for uncovering robust patterns, such as connected components, loops and voids, across scales. This paper provides an intuitive, figure-driven introduction to persistent homology and a practical, reproducible TDA pipeline for applied analysts. Through comparative case studies in consumer behavior, equity markets (SAX/eSAX vs.\ TDA) and foreign exchange dynamics, we demonstrate how topological features can reveal segmentation patterns and structural relationships beyond classical statistical methods. We discuss methodological choices regarding distance metrics, complex construction and interpretation, and we introduce the \textit{Topological Stability Index} (TSI), a simple yet interpretable indicator of structural variability derived from persistence lifetimes. We conclude with practical guidelines for TDA implementation, visualization and communication in business and economic analytics.",human
"Quantum machine learning (QML) has attracted growing interest with the rapid parallel advances in large-scale classical machine learning and quantum technologies. Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs.",human
"This study presents a systematic evaluation of time-frequency feature design for binaural sound source localization (SSL), focusing on how feature selection influences model performance across diverse conditions. We investigate the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using various combinations of amplitude-based features (magnitude spectrogram, interaural level difference - ILD) and phase-based features (phase spectrogram, interaural phase difference - IPD). Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain data with mismatched head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) reveal that carefully chosen feature combinations often outperform increases in model complexity. While two-feature sets such as ILD + IPD are sufficient for in-domain SSL, generalization to diverse content requires richer inputs combining channel spectrograms with both ILD and IPD. Using the optimal feature sets, our low-complexity CNN model achieves competitive performance. Our findings underscore the importance of feature design in binaural SSL and provide practical guidance for both domain-specific and general-purpose localization.",human
"Understanding sentiment in financial documents is crucial for gaining insights into market behavior. These reports often contain obfuscated language designed to present a positive or neutral outlook, even when underlying conditions may be less favorable. This paper presents a novel approach using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to decode obfuscated sentiment in Thai financial annual reports. We develop specific guidelines for annotating obfuscated sentiment in these texts and annotate more than one hundred financial reports. We then benchmark various text classification models on this annotated dataset, demonstrating strong performance in sentiment classification. Additionally, we conduct an event study to evaluate the real-world implications of our sentiment analysis on stock prices. Our results suggest that market reactions are selectively influenced by specific aspects within the reports. Our findings underscore the complexity of sentiment analysis in financial texts and highlight the importance of addressing obfuscated language to accurately assess market sentiment.",human
"This study focuses on understanding the complex dynamics between humans and AI systems by analyzing user reviews. While previous research has explored various aspects of human-AI interaction, such as user perceptions and ethical considerations, there remains a gap in understanding the specific concerns and challenges users face. By using a lexical approach to analyze 55,968 online reviews from G2.com, Producthunt.com, and Trustpilot.com, this preliminary research aims to analyze human-AI interaction. Initial results from factor analysis reveal key factors influencing these interactions. The study aims to provide deeper insights into these factors through content analysis, contributing to the development of more user-centric AI systems. The findings are expected to enhance our understanding of human-AI interaction and inform future AI technology and user experience improvements.",human
"Multimedia documents such as slide presentations and posters are designed to be interactive and easy to modify. Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline.",human
"Enhancing fuel efficiency in public transportation requires the integration of complex multimodal data into interpretable, decision-relevant insights. However, traditional analytics and visualization methods often yield fragmented outputs that demand extensive human interpretation, limiting scalability and consistency. This study presents a multi-agent framework that leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to automate data narration and energy insight generation. The framework coordinates three specialized agents, including a data narration agent, an LLM-as-a-judge agent, and an optional human-in-the-loop evaluator, to iteratively transform analytical artifacts into coherent, stakeholder-oriented reports. The system is validated through a real-world case study on public bus transportation in Northern Jutland, Denmark, where fuel efficiency data from 4006 trips are analyzed using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. Comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art LLMs and three prompting paradigms identify GPT-4.1 mini with Chain-of-Thought prompting as the optimal configuration, achieving 97.3% narrative accuracy while balancing interpretability and computational cost. The findings demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration significantly enhances factual precision, coherence, and scalability in LLM-based reporting. The proposed framework establishes a replicable and domain-adaptive methodology for AI-driven narrative generation and decision support in energy informatics.",human
"Environmental modeling faces critical challenges in predicting ecosystem dynamics across unmonitored regions due to limited and geographically imbalanced observation data. This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios. This work provides a practical solution for environmental applications where comprehensive monitoring is infeasible.",human
"Analytic Translation Quality Evaluation (TQE), based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), traditionally uses a linear error-to-penalty scale calibrated to a reference sample of 1000-2000 words. However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition.   Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size.   Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model   E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0,   anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added.   The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations. By operationalizing a perceptually valid scoring paradigm, it advances translation quality evaluation toward more accurate and scalable assessment. The model also provides a stronger basis for AI-based document-level evaluation aligned with human judgment. Implementation considerations for CAT/LQA systems and implications for human and AI-generated text evaluation are discussed.",human
"Data Driven Classroom Interviews (DDCIs) are an interviewing technique that is facilitated by recent technological developments in the learning analytics community. DDCIs are short, targeted interviews that allow researchers to contextualize students' interactions with a digital learning environment (e.g., intelligent tutoring systems or educational games) while minimizing the amount of time that the researcher interrupts that learning experience, and focusing researcher time on the events they most want to focus on DDCIs are facilitated by a research tool called the Quick Red Fox (QRF)--an open-source server-client Android app that optimizes researcher time by directing interviewers to users that have just displayed an interesting behavior (previously defined by the research team). QRF integrates with existing student modeling technologies (e.g., behavior-sensing, affect-sensing, detection of self-regulated learning) to alert researchers to key moments in a learner's experience. This manual documents the tech while providing training on the processes involved in developing triggers and interview techniques; it also suggests methods of analyses.",human
"Since the 21st century, artificial intelligence has been leading a new round of industrial revolution. Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamNX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to momentum SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamNX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/mengzhu0308/AdamNX.",human
"In the area of explainable artificial intelligence, Symbolic Regression (SR) has emerged as a promising approach by discovering interpretable mathematical expressions that fit data. However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture. Experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high interpretability, effectively extending symbolic regression to broader real-world multi-output tasks.",human
"With the growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large image-text and video-text datasets, it is critical to equip users with the tools to discern when to trust these systems. However, examining how user trust in VLMs builds and evolves remains an open problem. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing reliance on AI models as judges for experimental validation, to bypass the cost and implications of running participatory design studies directly with users. Following a user-centred approach, this paper presents preliminary results from a workshop with prospective VLM users. Insights from this pilot workshop inform future studies aimed at contextualising trust metrics and strategies for participants' engagement to fit the case of user-VLM interaction.",human
"Right heart failure (RHF) is a disease characterized by abnormalities in the structure or function of the right ventricle (RV), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice.",human
"The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence models into contemporary mobile computing is notable across numerous use cases, from virtual assistants to advanced image processing. Optimizing the mobile user experience involves minimal latency and high responsiveness from deployed AI models with challenges from execution strategies that fully leverage real time constraints to the exploitation of heterogeneous hardware architecture. In this paper, we research and propose the optimal execution configurations for AI models on an Android system, focusing on two critical tasks: object detection (YOLO family) and image classification (ResNet). These configurations evaluate various model quantization schemes and the utilization of on device accelerators, specifically the GPU and NPU. Our core objective is to empirically determine the combination that achieves the best trade-off between minimal accuracy degradation and maximal inference speed-up.",human
"Industrial process monitoring increasingly relies on sensor-generated time-series data, yet the lack of labels, high variability, and operational noise make it difficult to extract meaningful patterns using conventional methods. Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems.",human
"With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version.",human
"Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025; Georgiev et al., 2025), have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. However, the high-level descriptions in published work leave many implementation details unspecified, hindering reproducibility and further research. In this report we present GigaEvo, an extensible open-source framework that enables researchers to study and experiment with hybrid LLM-evolution approaches inspired by AlphaEvolve. Our system provides modular implementations of key components: MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithms, asynchronous DAG-based evaluation pipelines, LLM-driven mutation operators with insight generation and bidirectional lineage tracking, and flexible multi-island evolutionary strategies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation we evaluate GigaEvo on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: Heilbronn triangle placement, circle packing in squares, and high-dimensional kissing numbers. The framework emphasizes modularity, concurrency, and ease of experimentation, enabling rapid prototyping through declarative configuration. We provide detailed descriptions of system architecture, implementation decisions, and experimental methodology to support further research in LLM driven evolutionary methods. The GigaEvo framework and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/gigaevo-core.",human
"While data scaling laws of large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined in the one-pass regime with massive corpora, their form under limited data and repeated epochs remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of how a common workaround, training for multiple epochs on the same dataset, reshapes the data scaling laws in linear regression. Concretely, we ask: to match the performance of training on a dataset of size $N$ for $K$ epochs, how much larger must a dataset be if the model is trained for only one pass? We quantify this using the \textit{effective reuse rate} of the data, $E(K, N)$, which we define as the multiplicative factor by which the dataset must grow under one-pass training to achieve the same test loss as $K$-epoch training. Our analysis precisely characterizes the scaling behavior of $E(K, N)$ for SGD in linear regression under either strong convexity or Zipf-distributed data: (1) When $K$ is small, we prove that $E(K, N) \approx K$, indicating that every new epoch yields a linear gain; (2) As $K$ increases, $E(K, N)$ plateaus at a problem-dependent value that grows with $N$ ($Θ(\log N)$ for the strongly-convex case), implying that larger datasets can be repeated more times before the marginal benefit vanishes. These theoretical findings point out a neglected factor in a recent empirical study (Muennighoff et al. (2023)), which claimed that training LLMs for up to $4$ epochs results in negligible loss differences compared to using fresh data at each step, \textit{i.e.}, $E(K, N) \approx K$ for $K \le 4$ in our notation. Supported by further empirical validation with LLMs, our results reveal that the maximum $K$ value for which $E(K, N) \approx K$ in fact depends on the data size and distribution, and underscore the need to explicitly model both factors in future studies of scaling laws with data reuse.",human
"Accurate short-range prediction of extreme air temperature events remains a fundamental challenge in operational climate-risk management. We present Multi-Modal Weather State Transition Model with Anomaly-Driven Recurrent Attention Network Plus (MMWSTM-ADRAN+), a dual-stream deep learning architecture that couples a regime-aware dynamics model with an anomaly-focused attention mechanism to forecast daily maximum temperature and its extremes. The first stream, MMWSTM, combines bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) units with a learnable Markov state transition matrix to capture synoptic-scale weather regime changes. The second stream, ADRAN, integrates bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs), multi-head self-attention, and a novel anomaly amplification layer to enhance sensitivity to low-probability signals. A lightweight attentive fusion gate adaptively determines the contribution of each stream to the final prediction. Model optimization employs a custom ExtremeWeatherLoss function that up-weights errors on the upper 5% and lower 5% of the temperature distribution, and a time-series data augmentation suite (jittering, scaling, time/magnitude warping) that effectively quadruples the training data",human
"Open-domain question answering over datalakes requires retrieving and composing information from multiple tables, a challenging subtask that demands semantic relevance and structural coherence (e.g., joinability). While exact optimization methods like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) can ensure coherence, their computational complexity is often prohibitive. Conversely, simpler greedy heuristics that optimize for query coverage alone often fail to find these coherent, joinable sets. This paper frames multi-table retrieval as an iterative search process, arguing this approach offers advantages in scalability, interpretability, and flexibility. We propose a general framework and a concrete instantiation: a fast, effective Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval algorithm that holistically balances relevance, coverage, and joinability. Experiments across 5 NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that our iterative method achieves competitive retrieval performance compared to the MIP-based approach while being 4-400x faster depending on the benchmark and search space settings. This work highlights the potential of iterative heuristics for practical, scalable, and composition-aware retrieval.",human
"Visual document retrieval requires understanding heterogeneous and multi-modal content to satisfy information needs. Recent advances use screenshot-based document encoding with fine-grained late interaction, significantly improving retrieval performance. However, retrievers are still trained with coarse global relevance labels, without revealing which regions support the match. As a result, retrievers tend to rely on surface-level cues and struggle to capture implicit semantic connections, hindering their ability to handle non-extractive queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose a \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{G}rounded \textbf{RE}triever \textbf{E}nhancement (AGREE) framework. AGREE leverages cross-modal attention from multimodal large language models as proxy local supervision to guide the identification of relevant document regions. During training, AGREE combines local signals with the global signals to jointly optimize the retriever, enabling it to learn not only whether documents match, but also which content drives relevance. Experiments on the challenging ViDoRe V2 benchmark show that AGREE significantly outperforms the global-supervision-only baseline. Quantitative and qualitative analyses further demonstrate that AGREE promotes deeper alignment between query terms and document regions, moving beyond surface-level matching toward more accurate and interpretable retrieval. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AGREE-2025.",human
"Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.",human
"We propose a Kardashev-inspired yet operational Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale that measures the progression from fixed robotic process automation (AAI-0) to full artificial general intelligence (AAI-4) and beyond. Unlike narrative ladders, our scale is multi-axis and testable. We define ten capability axes (Autonomy, Generality, Planning, Memory/Persistence, Tool Economy, Self-Revision, Sociality/Coordination, Embodiment, World-Model Fidelity, Economic Throughput) aggregated by a composite AAI-Index (a weighted geometric mean). We introduce a measurable Self-Improvement Coefficient $κ$ (capability growth per unit of agent-initiated resources) and two closure properties (maintenance and expansion) that convert ``self-improving AI'' into falsifiable criteria. We specify OWA-Bench, an open-world agency benchmark suite that evaluates long-horizon, tool-using, persistent agents. We define level gates for AAI-0\ldots AAI-4 using thresholds on the axes, $κ$, and closure proofs. Synthetic experiments illustrate how present-day systems map onto the scale and how the delegability frontier (quality vs.\ autonomy) advances with self-improvement. We also prove a theorem that AAI-3 agent becomes AAI-5 over time with sufficient conditions, formalizing ""baby AGI"" becomes Superintelligence intuition.",human
"With the rise of smart personal devices, service-oriented human-agent interactions have become increasingly prevalent. This trend highlights the need for personalized dialogue assistants that can understand user-specific traits to accurately interpret requirements and tailor responses to individual preferences. However, existing approaches often overlook the complexities of long-term interactions and fail to capture users' subjective characteristics. To address these gaps, we present PAL-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization capabilities of service-oriented assistants in long-term user-agent interactions. In the absence of available real-world data, we develop a multi-step LLM-based synthesis pipeline, which is further verified and refined by human annotators. This process yields PAL-Set, the first Chinese dataset comprising multi-session user logs and dialogue histories, which serves as the foundation for PAL-Bench. Furthermore, to improve personalized service-oriented interactions, we propose H$^2$Memory, a hierarchical and heterogeneous memory framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to improve personalized response generation. Comprehensive experiments on both our PAL-Bench and an external dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed memory framework.",human
"Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus"" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.",human
"Scene Text Editing (STE) aims to naturally modify text in images while preserving visual consistency, the decisive factors of which can be divided into three parts, i.e., text style, text content, and background. Previous methods have struggled with incomplete disentanglement of editable attributes, typically addressing only one aspect - such as editing text content - thus limiting controllability and visual consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose TripleFDS, a novel framework for STE with disentangled modular attributes, and an accompanying dataset called SCB Synthesis. SCB Synthesis provides robust training data for triple feature disentanglement by utilizing the ""SCB Group"", a novel construct that combines three attributes per image to generate diverse, disentangled training groups. Leveraging this construct as a basic training unit, TripleFDS first disentangles triple features, ensuring semantic accuracy through inter-group contrastive regularization and reducing redundancy through intra-sample multi-feature orthogonality. In the synthesis phase, TripleFDS performs feature remapping to prevent ""shortcut"" phenomena during reconstruction and mitigate potential feature leakage. Trained on 125,000 SCB Groups, TripleFDS achieves state-of-the-art image fidelity (SSIM of 44.54) and text accuracy (ACC of 93.58%) on the mainstream STE benchmarks. Besides superior performance, the more flexible editing of TripleFDS supports new operations such as style replacement and background transfer. Code: https://github.com/yusenbao01/TripleFDS",human
"The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.",human
"Bayesian parameter inference for complex stochastic simulators is challenging due to intractable likelihood functions. Existing simulation-based inference methods often require large number of simulations and become costly to use in high-dimensional parameter spaces or in problems with partially uninformative outputs. We propose a new method for differentiable simulators that delivers accurate posterior inference with substantially reduced runtimes. Building on the Optimization Monte Carlo framework, our approach reformulates stochastic simulation as deterministic optimization problems. Gradient-based methods are then applied to efficiently navigate toward high-density posterior regions and avoid wasteful simulations in low-probability areas. A JAX-based implementation further enhances the performance through vectorization of key method components. Extensive experiments, including high-dimensional parameter spaces, uninformative outputs, multiple observations and multimodal posteriors show that our method consistently matches, and often exceeds, the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches, while reducing the runtime by a substantial margin.",human
"Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems.",human
"Improving energy efficiency in industrial foundry processes is a critical challenge, as these operations are highly energy-intensive and marked by complex interdependencies among process variables. Correlation-based analyses often fail to distinguish true causal drivers from spurious associations, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. This paper applies a time-series causal inference framework to identify the operational factors that directly affect energy efficiency in induction furnace melting. Using production data from a Danish foundry, the study integrates time-series clustering to segment melting cycles into distinct operational modes with the PCMCI+ algorithm, a state-of-the-art causal discovery method, to uncover cause-effect relationships within each mode. Across clusters, robust causal relations among energy consumption, furnace temperature, and material weight define the core drivers of efficiency, while voltage consistently influences cooling water temperature with a delayed response. Cluster-specific differences further distinguish operational regimes: efficient clusters are characterized by stable causal structures, whereas inefficient ones exhibit reinforcing feedback loops and atypical dependencies. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it introduces an integrated clustering-causal inference pipeline as a methodological innovation for analyzing energy-intensive processes. Second, it provides actionable insights that enable foundry operators to optimize performance, reduce energy consumption, and lower emissions.",human
"Recently, the Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCM) was proposed. DDCM leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and replaces the random noise in the backward process with noise sampled from specific sets according to a predefined rule, thereby enabling image compression. However, DDCM cannot be applied to methods other than DDPM. In this paper, we propose the generalized Denoising Diffusion Compression Model (gDDCM), which extends DDCM to mainstream diffusion models and their variants, including DDPM, Score-Based Models, Consistency Models, and Rectified Flow. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10 and LSUN Bedroom datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully generalizes DDCM to the aforementioned models and achieves improved performance.",human
"With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.",human
"Diagrams are crucial yet underexplored tools in many disciplines, demonstrating the close connection between visual representation and scholarly reasoning. However, their iconic form poses obstacles to visual studies, intermedial analysis, and text-based digital workflows. In particular, Charles S. Peirce consistently advocated the use of diagrams as essential for reasoning and explanation. His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM. In addition, by adopting Peirce's semiotic framework, we designed prompts to extract key knowledge about diagrams and produce concise captions. Finally, we integrated these captions into knowledge graphs, enabling structured representations of diagrammatic content within composite sources.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in distributed healthcare, including consolidating specialized domain knowledge across institutions while maintaining privacy, reducing computational overhead, and preventing catastrophic forgetting during model updates.This paper presents a systematic evaluation of six parameter-space merging techniques applied to two architecturally compatible medical LLMs derived from the Mistral-7B base model. We introduce a novel hierarchical method that combines selective Optimal Transport (OT) alignment for attention layers with cosine similarity-weighted interpolation, designed to address permutation variance while minimizing computational overhead for edge deployment scenarios. Our study evaluates Task Arithmetic, Linear Averaging, DARE-TIES, DELLA, Breadcrumbs, and our Hierarchical approach across five medical benchmarks. Results demonstrate that architecturally compatible models benefit significantly from simple averaging methods, with Task Arithmetic achieving 45.80% accuracy on MedQA, outperforming complex pruning-based approaches. These findings offer critical insights for the deployment of distributed medical AI in resource-constrained IoT environments, where computational efficiency and model compatibility are paramount. Our work establishes that for architecturally compatible models, simple averaging provides a robust and computationally efficient baseline for knowledge consolidation, offering a pragmatic path forward for scalable medical AI systems.",human
"How do large language models solve spatial navigation tasks? We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly across tasks and languages, yet how improvements in one task or language affect other tasks and languages and their combinations remains poorly understood. We conduct a controlled PEFT/LoRA study across multiple open-weight LLM families and sizes, treating task and language as transfer axes while conditioning on model family and size; we fine-tune each model on a single task-language source and measure transfer as the percentage-point change versus its baseline score when evaluated on all other task-language target pairs. We decompose transfer into (i) Matched-Task (Cross-Language), (ii) Matched-Language (Cross-Task), and (iii) Cross-Task (Cross-Language) regimes. We uncover two consistent general patterns. First, a pronounced on-task vs. off-task asymmetry: Matched-Task (Cross-Language) transfer is reliably positive, whereas off-task transfer often incurs collateral degradation. Second, a stable donor-recipient structure across languages and tasks (hub donors vs. brittle recipients). We outline implications for risk-aware fine-tuning and model specialisation.",human
"Split inference (SI) enables users to access deep learning (DL) services without directly transmitting raw data. However, recent studies reveal that data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) can recover the original inputs from the smashed data sent from the client to the server, leading to significant privacy leakage. While various defenses have been proposed, they often result in substantial utility degradation, particularly when the client-side model is shallow. We identify a key cause of this trade-off: existing defenses apply excessive perturbation to redundant information in the smashed data. To address this issue in computer vision tasks, we propose InfoDecom, a defense framework that first decomposes and removes redundant information and then injects noise calibrated to provide theoretically guaranteed privacy. Experiments demonstrate that InfoDecom achieves a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to existing baselines. The code and the appendix are available at https://github.com/SASA-cloud/InfoDecom.",human
"Medical coding converts free-text clinical notes into standardized diagnostic and procedural codes, which are essential for billing, hospital operations, and medical research. Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems.",human
"The advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models enable them to thoroughly understand and apply safety policies through deliberate thought processes, thereby improving the models' safety. Beyond safety, these models must also be able to reflect the diverse range of human values across various cultures. This paper presents the Cultural Norm-based Cultural Alignment (CNCA) framework, which enables models to leverage their powerful reasoning ability to align with cultural norms. Specifically, we propose three methods to automatically mine cultural norms from limited survey data and explore ways to effectively utilize these norms for improving cultural alignment. Two alignment paradigms are examined: an in-context alignment method, where cultural norms are explicitly integrated into the user context, and a fine-tuning-based method, which internalizes norms through enhanced Chain-of-Thought training data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, highlighting that models with stronger reasoning capabilities benefit more from cultural norm mining and utilization. Our findings emphasize the potential for reasoning models to better reflect diverse human values through culturally informed alignment strategies.",human
"Backdoor attacks pose severe threats to machine learning systems, prompting extensive research in this area. However, most existing work focuses on single-target All-to-One (A2O) attacks, overlooking the more complex All-to-X (A2X) attacks with multiple target classes, which are often assumed to have low attack success rates. In this paper, we first demonstrate that A2X attacks are robust against state-of-the-art defenses. We then propose a novel attack strategy that enhances the success rate of A2X attacks while maintaining robustness by optimizing grouping and target class assignment mechanisms. Our method improves the attack success rate by up to 28%, with average improvements of 6.7%, 16.4%, 14.1% on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively. We anticipate that this study will raise awareness of A2X attacks and stimulate further research in this under-explored area. Our code is available at https://github.com/kazefjj/A2X-backdoor .",human
"Retinal image quality assessment (RIQA) supports computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases. However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture.",human
"Food analysis has become increasingly critical for health-related tasks such as personalized nutrition and chronic disease prevention. However, existing large multimodal models (LMMs) in food analysis suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks, requiring costly retraining from scratch. To address this, we propose a novel continual learning framework for multimodal food learning, integrating a Dual-LoRA architecture with Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay. We introduce two complementary low-rank adapters for each task: a specialized LoRA that learns task-specific knowledge with orthogonal constraints to previous tasks' subspaces, and a cooperative LoRA that consolidates shared knowledge across tasks via pseudo replay. To improve the reliability of replay data, our Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay strategy leverages self-consistency and semantic similarity to reduce hallucinations in generated samples. Experiments on the comprehensive Uni-Food dataset show superior performance in mitigating forgetting, representing the first effective continual learning approach for complex food tasks.",human
"In modern software development workflows, the open-source software supply chain contributes significantly to efficient and convenient engineering practices. With increasing system complexity, using open-source software as third-party dependencies has become a common practice. However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident. To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software. The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage. In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem. The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks.",human
"Rock discontinuities critically govern the mechanical behavior and stability of rock masses. Their internal distributions remain largely unobservable and are typically inferred from surface-exposed discontinuities using generative prediction approaches. However, surface-exposed observations are inherently sparse, and existing generative prediction approaches either fail to capture the underlying complex distribution patterns or lack robustness under data-sparse conditions. Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches. This work advances quantitative characterization of rock mass structures, supporting safer and more reliable data-driven geotechnical design.",human
"Supervised learning with tabular data presents unique challenges, including low data sizes, the absence of structural cues, and heterogeneous features spanning both categorical and continuous domains. Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.",human
"The hospitality industry in the Arab world increasingly relies on customer feedback to shape services, driving the need for advanced Arabic sentiment analysis tools. To address this challenge, the Sentiment Analysis on Arabic Dialects in the Hospitality Domain shared task focuses on Sentiment Detection in Arabic Dialects. This task leverages a multi-dialect, manually curated dataset derived from hotel reviews originally written in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and translated into Saudi and Moroccan (Darija) dialects. The dataset consists of 538 sentiment-balanced reviews spanning positive, neutral, and negative categories. Translations were validated by native speakers to ensure dialectal accuracy and sentiment preservation. This resource supports the development of dialect-aware NLP systems for real-world applications in customer experience analysis. More than 40 teams have registered for the shared task, with 12 submitting systems during the evaluation phase. The top-performing system achieved an F1 score of 0.81, demonstrating the feasibility and ongoing challenges of sentiment analysis across Arabic dialects.",human
"Generating thorough natural language explanations for threat detections remains an open problem in cybersecurity research, despite significant advances in automated malware detection systems. In this work, we present AutoMalDesc, an automated static analysis summarization framework that, following initial training on a small set of expert-curated examples, operates independently at scale. This approach leverages an iterative self-paced learning pipeline to progressively enhance output quality through synthetic data generation and validation cycles, eliminating the need for extensive manual data annotation. Evaluation across 3,600 diverse samples in five scripting languages demonstrates statistically significant improvements between iterations, showing consistent gains in both summary quality and classification accuracy. Our comprehensive validation approach combines quantitative metrics based on established malware labels with qualitative assessment from both human experts and LLM-based judges, confirming both technical precision and linguistic coherence of generated summaries. To facilitate reproducibility and advance research in this domain, we publish our complete dataset of more than 100K script samples, including annotated seed (0.9K) and test (3.6K) datasets, along with our methodology and evaluation framework.",human
"Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) is an effective and convenient deployment solution for addressing various NLP tasks. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS.",human
"Creating offensive advantages during open play is fundamental to football success. However, due to the highly dynamic and long-sequence nature of open play, the potential tactic space grows exponentially as the sequence progresses, making automated tactic discovery extremely challenging. To address this, we propose TacEleven, a generative framework for football open-play tactic discovery developed in close collaboration with domain experts from AJ Auxerre, designed to assist coaches and analysts in tactical decision-making. TacEleven consists of two core components: a language-controlled tactical generator that produces diverse tactical proposals, and a multimodal large language model-based tactical critic that selects the optimal proposal aligned with a high-level stylistic tactical instruction. The two components enables rapid exploration of tactical proposals and discovery of alternative open-play offensive tactics. We evaluate TacEleven across three tasks with progressive tactical complexity: counterfactual exploration, single-step discovery, and multi-step discovery, through both quantitative metrics and a questionnaire-based qualitative assessment. The results show that the TacEleven-discovered tactics exhibit strong realism and tactical creativity, with 52.50% of the multi-step tactical alternatives rated adoptable in real-world elite football scenarios, highlighting the framework's ability to rapidly generate numerous high-quality tactics for complex long-sequence open-play situations. TacEleven demonstrates the potential of creatively leveraging domain data and generative models to advance tactical analysis in sports.",human
"Deep Reinforcement Learning is one of the state-of-the-art methods for producing near-optimal system controllers. However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller. We evaluate our approach on a gridworld environment and a classic control task. We observe that our proposed distillation to locally- specialized linear models produces policies that are explainable and show that the distillation matches or even slightly outperforms the black-box policy they are distilled from.",human
"Users increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for personal, emotionally charged, and socially sensitive conversations. However, prompts sent to cloud-hosted models can contain personally identifiable information (PII) that users do not want logged, retained, or leaked. We observe this to be especially acute when users discuss friends, coworkers, or adversaries, i.e., when they spill the tea. Enterprises face the same challenge when they want to use LLMs for internal communication and decision-making.   In this whitepaper, we present Whistledown, a best-effort privacy layer that modifies prompts before they are sent to the LLM. Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $ε$-local differential privacy ($ε$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility. Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users. For enterprise users, Whistledown is deployed centrally within a zero-trust gateway that runs on an enterprise's trusted infrastructure. Whistledown requires no changes to the existing APIs of popular LLM providers.",human
"Group activity detection in multi-person scenes is challenging due to complex human interactions, occlusions, and variations in appearance over time. This work presents a computer vision based framework for group activity recognition and action spotting using a combination of deep learning models and graph based relational reasoning. The system first applies Mask R-CNN to obtain accurate actor localization through bounding boxes and instance masks. Multiple backbone networks, including Inception V3, MobileNet, and VGG16, are used to extract feature maps, and RoIAlign is applied to preserve spatial alignment when generating actor specific features. The mask information is then fused with the feature maps to obtain refined masked feature representations for each actor. To model interactions between individuals, we construct Actor Relation Graphs that encode appearance similarity and positional relations using methods such as normalized cross correlation, sum of absolute differences, and dot product. Graph Convolutional Networks operate on these graphs to reason about relationships and predict both individual actions and group level activities. Experiments on the Collective Activity dataset demonstrate that the combination of mask based feature refinement, robust similarity search, and graph neural network reasoning leads to improved recognition performance across both crowded and non crowded scenarios. This approach highlights the potential of integrating segmentation, feature extraction, and relational graph reasoning for complex video understanding tasks.",human
"Acting in human environments is a crucial capability for general-purpose robots, necessitating a robust understanding of natural language and its application to physical tasks. This paper seeks to harness the capabilities of diffusion models within a visuomotor policy framework that merges visual and textual inputs to generate precise robotic trajectories. By employing reference demonstrations during training, the model learns to execute manipulation tasks specified through textual commands within the robot's immediate environment. The proposed research aims to extend an existing model by leveraging improved embeddings, and adapting techniques from diffusion models for image generation. We evaluate our methods on the CALVIN dataset, proving enhanced performance on various manipulation tasks and an increased long-horizon success rate when multiple tasks are executed in sequence. Our approach reinforces the usefulness of diffusion models and contributes towards general multitask manipulation.",human
"Gaining sustainable performance improvement with scaling data and model budget remains a pivotal yet unresolved challenge in autonomous driving. While autoregressive models exhibited promising data-scaling efficiency in planning tasks, predicting ego trajectories alone suffers sparse supervision and weakly constrains how scene evolution should shape ego motion. Therefore, we introduce DAP, a discrete-token autoregressive planner that jointly forecasts BEV semantics and ego trajectories, thereby enforcing comprehensive representation learning and allowing predicted dynamics to directly condition ego motion. In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark. Overall, the fully discrete-token autoregressive formulation operating on both rasterized BEV and ego actions provides a compact yet scalable planning paradigm for autonomous driving.",human
"Biomarker discovery from high-throughput transcriptomic data is crucial for advancing precision medicine. However, existing methods often neglect gene-gene regulatory relationships and lack stability across datasets, leading to conflation of spurious correlations with genuine causal effects. To address these issues, we develop a causal graph neural network (Causal-GNN) method that integrates causal inference with multi-layer graph neural networks (GNNs). The key innovation is the incorporation of causal effect estimation for identifying stable biomarkers, coupled with a GNN-based propensity scoring mechanism that leverages cross-gene regulatory networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistently high predictive accuracy across four distinct datasets and four independent classifiers. Moreover, it enables the identification of more stable biomarkers compared to traditional methods. Our work provides a robust, efficient, and biologically interpretable tool for biomarker discovery, demonstrating strong potential for broad application across medical disciplines.",human
"Accurate healthcare prediction is critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing operational costs. Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \underline{g}enerative \underline{h}ierarchical \underline{a}gentic \underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems.",human
"Humans display significant uncertainty when confronted with moral dilemmas, yet the extent of such uncertainty in machines and AI agents remains underexplored. Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via ""dropout"" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios.",human
"Multi-agent systems perform well on general reasoning tasks. However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks.",human
"GPU kernels are critical for ML performance but difficult to optimize across diverse accelerators. We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms.   We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.",human
"Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have recently shown impressive progress in speech recognition, audio captioning, and auditory question answering. Yet, whether these models can perceive spatial dynamics, particularly the motion of sound sources, remains unclear. In this work, we uncover a systematic motion perception deficit in current ALLMs. To investigate this issue, we introduce AMPBench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate auditory motion understanding. AMPBench introduces a controlled question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate whether Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can infer the direction and trajectory of moving sound sources from binaural audio. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that current models struggle to reliably recognize motion cues or distinguish directional patterns. The average accuracy remains below 50%, underscoring a fundamental limitation in auditory spatial reasoning. Our study highlights a fundamental gap between human and model auditory spatial reasoning, providing both a diagnostic tool and new insight for enhancing spatial cognition in future Audio-Language Models.",human
"The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT has created new opportunities and challenges for computing education. Existing research has primarily focused on GenAI's ability to complete educational tasks and its impact on student performance, often overlooking its effects on knowledge gains. In this study, we investigate how GenAI assistance compares to conventional online resources in supporting knowledge gains across different proficiency levels. We conducted a controlled user experiment with 24 undergraduate students of two different levels of programming experience (beginner, intermediate) to examine how students interact with ChatGPT while solving programming tasks. We analyzed task performance, conceptual understanding, and interaction behaviors. Our findings reveal that generating complete solutions with GenAI significantly improves task performance, especially for beginners, but does not consistently result in knowledge gains. Importantly, usage strategies differ by experience: beginners tend to rely heavily on GenAI toward task completion often without knowledge gain in the process, while intermediates adopt more selective approaches. We find that both over-reliance and minimal use result in weaker knowledge gains overall. Based on our results, we call on students and educators to adopt GenAI as a learning rather than a problem solving tool. Our study highlights the urgent need for guidance when integrating GenAI into programming education to foster deeper understanding.",human
"This work presents a case study of a heterogeneous multiphysics solver from the nuclear fusion domain. At the macroscopic scale, an auto-differentiable ODE solver in JAX computes the evolution of the pulsed power circuit and bulk plasma parameters for a compressing Z Pinch. The ODE solver requires a closure for the impedance of the plasma load obtained via root-finding at every timestep, which we solve efficiently using gradient-based Newton iteration. However, incorporating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll (a C/CUDA plasma simulation suite) into a gradient-based workflow is non-trivial. The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter). This architecture ensures end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers (Gkeyll), neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid, progressive prototyping.",human
"Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, however their knowledge and abilities in the cross-view geo-localization and pose estimation domains remain unexplored, despite potential benefits for navigation, autonomous driving, outdoor robotics, \textit{etc}. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{GeoX-Bench}, a comprehensive \underline{Bench}mark designed to explore and evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in \underline{cross}-view \underline{Geo}-localization and pose estimation. Specifically, GeoX-Bench contains 10,859 panoramic-satellite image pairs spanning 128 cities in 49 countries, along with corresponding 755,976 question-answering (QA) pairs. Among these, 42,900 QA pairs are designated for benchmarking, while the remaining are intended to enhance the capabilities of LMMs. Based on GeoX-Bench, we evaluate the capabilities of 25 state-of-the-art LMMs on cross-view geo-localization and pose estimation tasks, and further explore the empowered capabilities of instruction-tuning. Our benchmark demonstrate that while current LMMs achieve impressive performance in geo-localization tasks, their effectiveness declines significantly on the more complex pose estimation tasks, highlighting a critical area for future improvement, and instruction-tuning LMMs on the training data of GeoX-Bench can significantly improve the cross-view geo-sense abilities.

"We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but their training remains resource- and time-intensive, requiring massive compute power and careful orchestration of training procedures. Model souping-the practice of averaging weights from multiple models of the same architecture-has emerged as a promising pre- and post-training technique that can enhance performance without expensive retraining. In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance. Contrary to previous uniform-averaging approaches, our method leverages the observation that benchmark categories often exhibit low inter-correlations in model performance. SoCE identifies ""expert"" models for each weakly-correlated category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging rather than uniform weights. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance and robustness across multiple domains, including multilingual capabilities, tool calling, and math and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard.",human
"We present reproducible, edge-aware baselines for ogbn-proteins in PyTorch Geometric (PyG). We study two system choices that dominate practice: (i) how 8-dimensional edge evidence is aggregated into node inputs, and (ii) how edges are used inside message passing. Our strongest baseline is GraphSAGE with sum-based edge-to-node features. We compare LayerNorm (LN), BatchNorm (BN), and a species-aware Conditional LayerNorm (CLN), and report compute cost (time, VRAM, parameters) together with accuracy (ROC-AUC) and decision quality. In our primary experimental setup (hidden size 512, 3 layers, 3 seeds), sum consistently beats mean and max; BN attains the best AUC, while CLN matches the AUC frontier with better thresholded F1. Finally, post-hoc per-label temperature scaling plus per-label thresholds substantially improves micro-F1 and expected calibration error (ECE) with negligible AUC change, and light label-correlation smoothing yields small additional gains. We release standardized artifacts and scripts used for all of the runs presented in the paper.",human
"This EPTCS volume contains the papers from the Seventh International Workshop on Formal Methods for Autonomous Systems (FMAS 2025), which was held between the 17th and 19th of November 2025. The goal of the FMAS workshop series is to bring together leading researchers who are using formal methods to tackle the unique challenges that autonomous systems present, so that they can publish and discuss their work with a growing community of researchers. FMAS 2025 was co-located with the 20th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM'25), hosted by Inria Paris, France at the Inria Paris Center.    In total, FMAS 2025 received 16 submissions from researchers at institutions in: Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. Though we received fewer submissions than last year, we are encouraged to see the submissions being sent from a wide range of countries. Submissions come from both past and new FMAS authors, which shows us that the existing community appreciates the network that FMAS has built over the past 7 years, while new authors also show the FMAS community's great potential of growth.",human
"Accurate protein structures are essential for understanding biological function, yet incorporating experimental data into protein generative models remains a major challenge. Most predictors of experimental observables are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with gradient-based conditional sampling. This is especially limiting in nuclear magnetic resonance, where rich data such as chemical shifts are hard to directly integrate into generative modeling. We introduce a framework for non-differentiable guidance of protein generative models, coupling a continuous diffusion-based generator with any black-box objective via a tailored genetic algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness across three modalities: pairwise distance constraints, nuclear Overhauser effect restraints, and for the first time chemical shifts. These results establish chemical shift guided structure generation as feasible, expose key weaknesses in current predictors, and showcase a general strategy for incorporating diverse experimental signals. Our work points toward automated, data-conditioned protein modeling beyond the limits of differentiability.",human
"Multimodal Model Editing (MMED) aims to correct erroneous knowledge in multimodal models. Existing evaluation methods, adapted from textual model editing, overstate success by relying on low-similarity or random inputs, obscure overfitting. We propose a comprehensive locality evaluation framework, covering three key dimensions: random-image locality, no-image locality, and consistent-image locality, operationalized through seven distinct data types, enabling a detailed and structured analysis of multimodal edits. We introduce De-VQA, a dynamic evaluation for visual question answering, uncovering a phenomenon we term transient blindness, overfitting to edit-similar text while ignoring visuals. Token analysis shows edits disproportionately affect textual tokens. We propose locality-aware adversarial losses to balance cross-modal representations. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing transient blindness and improving locality by 17% on average.",human
"Real-world tasks and environments exhibit differences from the static datasets that large language models (LLMs) are typically evaluated on. Such tasks can involve sequential interaction, requiring coherent updating of beliefs in light of new evidence, and making appropriate decisions based on those beliefs. Predicting how LLMs will perform in such dynamic environments is important, but can be tricky to determine from measurements in static settings. In this work, we examine two critical components of LLM performance: the ability of LLMs to coherently update their beliefs, and the extent to which the actions they take are consistent with those beliefs. First, we find that LLMs are largely inconsistent in how they update their beliefs; models can exhibit up to a 30% average difference between the directly elicited posterior, and the correct update of their prior. Second, we find that LLMs also often take actions which are inconsistent with the beliefs they hold. On a betting market, for example, LLMs often do not even bet in the same direction as their internally held beliefs over the underlying outcomes. We also find they have moderate self-inconsistency in how they respond to challenges by users to given answers. Finally, we show that the above properties hold even for strong models that obtain high accuracy or that are well-calibrated on the tasks at hand. Our results highlight the difficulties of predicting LLM behavior in complex real-world settings.",human
"This article presents the first systematic review of unsupervised and semi-supervised computational text-based ideal point estimation (CT-IPE) algorithms, methods designed to infer latent political positions from textual data. These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.",human
"Recent advances in deep learning have improved multivariate time series (MTS) classification and regression by capturing complex patterns, but their lack of transparency hinders decision-making. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer partial insights, yet often fall short of conveying the full decision space. Counterfactual Explanations (CE) provide a promising alternative, but current approaches typically prioritize either accuracy, proximity or sparsity -- rarely all -- limiting their practical value. To address this, we propose CONFETTI, a novel multi-objective CE method for MTS. CONFETTI identifies key MTS subsequences, locates a counterfactual target, and optimally modifies the time series to balance prediction confidence, proximity and sparsity. This method provides actionable insights with minimal changes, improving interpretability, and decision support. CONFETTI is evaluated on seven MTS datasets from the UEA archive, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains. CONFETTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CE methods in its optimization objectives, and in six other metrics from the literature, achieving $\geq10\%$ higher confidence while improving sparsity in $\geq40\%$.",human
"Traditional gradient boosting algorithms employ static tree structures with fixed splitting criteria that remain unchanged throughout training, limiting their ability to adapt to evolving gradient distributions and problem-specific characteristics across different learning stages. This work introduces MorphBoost, a new gradient boosting framework featuring self-organizing tree structures that dynamically morph their splitting behavior during training. The algorithm implements adaptive split functions that evolve based on accumulated gradient statistics and iteration-dependent learning pressures, enabling automatic adjustment to problem complexity. Key innovations include: (1) morphing split criterion combining gradient-based scores with information-theoretic metrics weighted by training progress; (2) automatic problem fingerprinting for intelligent parameter configuration across binary/multiclass/regression tasks; (3) vectorized tree prediction achieving significant computational speedups; (4) interaction-aware feature importance detecting multiplicative relationships; and (5) fast-mode optimization balancing speed and accuracy. Comprehensive benchmarking across 10 diverse datasets against competitive models (XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting, HistGradientBoosting, ensemble methods) demonstrates that MorphBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming XGBoost by 0.84% on average. MorphBoost secured the overall winner position with 4/10 dataset wins (40% win rate) and 6/30 top-3 finishes (20%), while maintaining the lowest variance (σ=0.0948) and highest minimum accuracy across all models, revealing superior consistency and robustness. Performance analysis across difficulty levels shows competitive results on easy datasets while achieving notable improvements on advanced problems due to higher adaptation levels.",human
"The manifold hypothesis posits that high-dimensional data typically resides on low-dimensional sub spaces. In this paper, we assume manifold hypothesis to investigate graph-based semi-supervised learning   methods. In particular, we examine Laplace Learning in the Wasserstein space, extending the classical   notion of graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to   an infinite-dimensional setting. To achieve this, we prove variational convergence of a discrete graph p- Dirichlet energy to its continuum counterpart. In addition, we characterize the Laplace-Beltrami operator   on asubmanifold of the Wasserstein space. Finally, we validate the proposed theoretical framework through   numerical experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the consistency of our classification performance in high-dimensional settings.",human
"When a robot is asked to verbalize its plan it can do it in many ways. For example, a seemingly natural strategy is incremental, where the robot verbalizes its planned actions in plan order. However, an important aspect of this type of strategy is that it misses considerations on what is effectively informative to communicate, because not considering what the user knows prior to explanations. In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order. In addition, following our formulation we hint to what is informative and why when a robot communicates its plan.",human
"With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their vision-enabled counterparts (VLMs), numerous works have investigated their capabilities in tasks that fuse the modalities of vision and language. In this work, we benchmark the extent to which VLMs are able to act as highly-trained phoneticians, interpreting spectrograms and waveforms of speech. To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth. We observe that both zero-shot and finetuned models rarely perform above chance, demonstrating the requirement for specific parametric knowledge of how to interpret such figures, rather than paired samples alone.",human
"Emerging reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces. However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications.

"The transformer architecture has demonstrated strong performance in classification tasks involving structured and high-dimensional data. However, its success often hinges on large- scale training data and careful regularization to prevent overfitting. In this paper, we intro- duce a novel likelihood-guided variational Ising-based regularization framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs), which simultaneously enhances model generalization and dynamically prunes redundant parameters. The proposed variational Ising-based regularization approach leverages Bayesian sparsification techniques to impose structured sparsity on model weights, allowing for adaptive architecture search during training. Unlike traditional dropout-based methods, which enforce fixed sparsity patterns, the variational Ising-based regularization method learns task-adaptive regularization, improving both efficiency and interpretability. We evaluate our approach on benchmark vision datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved generalization under sparse, complex data and allowing for principled uncertainty quantification on both weights and selection parameters. Additionally, we show that the Ising regularizer leads to better-calibrated probability estimates and structured feature selection through uncertainty-aware attention mechanisms. Our results highlight the effectiveness of structured Bayesian sparsification in enhancing transformer-based architectures, offering a principled alternative to standard regularization techniques.",human
"Video-to-audio generation (V2A) is of increasing importance in domains such as film post-production, AR/VR, and sound design, particularly for the creation of Foley sound effects synchronized with on-screen actions. Foley requires generating audio that is both semantically aligned with visible events and temporally aligned with their timing. Yet, there is a mismatch between evaluation and downstream applications due to the absence of a benchmark tailored to Foley-style scenarios. We find that 74% of videos from past evaluation datasets have poor audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, they are dominated by speech and music, domains that lie outside the use case for Foley. To address this gap, we introduce FoleyBench, the first large-scale benchmark explicitly designed for Foley-style V2A evaluation. FoleyBench contains 5,000 (video, ground-truth audio, text caption) triplets, each featuring visible sound sources with audio causally tied to on-screen events. The dataset is built using an automated, scalable pipeline applied to in-the-wild internet videos from YouTube-based and Vimeo-based sources. Compared to past datasets, we show that videos from FoleyBench have stronger coverage of sound categories from a taxonomy specifically designed for Foley sound. Each clip is further labeled with metadata capturing source complexity, UCS/AudioSet category, and video length, enabling fine-grained analysis of model performance and failure modes. We benchmark several state-of-the-art V2A models, evaluating them on audio quality, audio-video alignment, temporal synchronization, and audio-text consistency.

"The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a classical scheduling problem that has received significant attention due to of its numerous applications in industry. However, in practice, task durations are subject to uncertainty that must be considered in order to propose resilient scheduling. In this paper, we address the RCPSP variant with uncertain tasks duration (modeled using known probabilities) and aim to minimize the overall expected project duration. Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize. The developed framework, Wheatley, is made publicly available online to facilitate further research and reproducibility.",human
"Dynamic sequences with varying lengths have been widely used in the training of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). However, current training frameworks adopt a pre-defined static parallel strategy for these sequences, causing neither communication-parallelization cancellation on short sequences nor out-of-memory on long sequences. To mitigate these issues, we propose ParaDySe, a novel adaptive Parallel strategy switching framework for Dynamic Sequences. ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries. We compare ParaDySe with baselines on representative LLMs under datasets with sequence lengths up to 624K. Experimental results indicate that ParaDySe addresses OOM and CPC bottlenecks in LLM training by systematically integrating long-sequence optimizations with existing frameworks.",human
"Application of phylogenetic methods to textual traditions has traditionally treated all changes as equivalent even though it is widely recognized that certain types of variants were more likely to be introduced than others. While it is possible to give weights to certain changes using a maximum parsimony evaluation criterion, it is difficult to state a priori what these weights should be. Probabilistic methods, such as Bayesian phylogenetics, allow users to create categories of changes, and the transition rates for each category can be estimated as part of the analysis. This classification of types of changes in readings also allows for inspecting the probability of these categories across each branch in the resulting trees. However, classification of readings is time-consuming, as it requires categorizing each reading against every other reading at each variation unit, presenting a significant barrier to entry for this kind of analysis. This paper presents Rdgai, a software package that automates this classification task using multi-lingual large language models (LLMs). The tool allows users to easily manually classify changes in readings and then it uses these annotations in the prompt for an LLM to automatically classify the remaining reading transitions. These classifications are stored in TEI XML and ready for downstream phylogenetic analysis. This paper demonstrates the application with data an Arabic translation of the Gospels.",human
"Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) often suffer from inefficient ""free-for-all"" communication, leading to exponential token costs and low signal-to-noise ratios that hinder their practical deployment. We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that ""free"" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints.",human
"Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $ε$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies. Our approach achieves up to 3$\times$ faster convergence and 30$\times$ higher success rates on average against RL-based baselines, demonstrating its robustness to opponent strategies and stability across training iterations",human
"Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy is a powerful and rapid technique widely used in medicine, material science, and chemical analyses. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the presence of a non-resonant background that interferes with and distorts the true Raman signal. Deep learning methods have been employed to reconstruct the true Raman spectrum from measured CARS data using labeled datasets. A more recent development integrates the domain knowledge of Kramers-Kronig relationships and smoothness constraints in the form of physics-informed loss functions. However, these deterministic models lack the ability to quantify uncertainty, an essential feature for reliable deployment in high-stakes scientific and biomedical applications. In this work, we evaluate and compare various uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques within the context of CARS-to-Raman signal reconstruction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating physics-informed constraints into these models improves their calibration, offering a promising path toward more trustworthy CARS data analysis.",human
"Automatic diacritic restoration is crucial for text processing in languages with rich diacritical marks, such as Romanian. This study evaluates the performance of several large language models (LLMs) in restoring diacritics in Romanian texts. Using a comprehensive corpus, we tested models including OpenAI's GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Google's Gemini 1.0 Pro, Meta's Llama 2 and Llama 3, MistralAI's Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, airoboros 70B, and OpenLLM-Ro's RoLlama 2 7B, under multiple prompt templates ranging from zero-shot to complex multi-shot instructions. Results show that models such as GPT-4o achieve high diacritic restoration accuracy, consistently surpassing a neutral echo baseline, while others, including Meta's Llama family, exhibit wider variability. These findings highlight the impact of model architecture, training data, and prompt design on diacritic restoration performance and outline promising directions for improving NLP tools for diacritic-rich languages.",human
"The translation of written language has been known since the 3rd century BC; however, its necessity has become increasingly common in the information age. Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators. Results are based on MarianMT, T5-Base and NLLB-200 translators.",human
"With the development of digital twins and smart manufacturing systems, there is an urgent need for real-time distortion field prediction to control defects in metal Additive Manufacturing (AM). However, numerical simulation methods suffer from high computational cost, long run-times that prevent real-time use, while conventional Machine learning (ML) models struggle to extract spatiotemporal features for long-horizon prediction and fail to decouple thermo-mechanical fields. This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively. The error distribution shows high errors in the molten pool but low gradient norms in the deposited and key areas. The performance of PINO surrogate model highlights its potential for real-time long-horizon physics field prediction in controlling defects.",human
"Quadratic programming (QP) solvers are widely used in real-time control and optimization, but their computational cost often limits applicability in time-critical settings. We propose a learning-to-optimize approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict active sets in the dual active-set solver DAQP. The method exploits the structural properties of QPs by representing them as bipartite graphs and learning to identify the optimal active set for efficiently warm-starting the solver. Across varying problem sizes, the GNN consistently reduces the number of solver iterations compared to cold-starting, while performance is comparable to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline. Furthermore, a GNN trained on varying problem sizes generalizes effectively to unseen dimensions, demonstrating flexibility and scalability. These results highlight the potential of structure-aware learning to accelerate optimization in real-time applications such as model predictive control.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in general domains, yet their application in highly specialized and culturally-rich fields like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) requires rigorous and nuanced evaluation. Building upon prior foundational work such as TCM-3CEval, which highlighted systemic knowledge gaps and the importance of cultural-contextual alignment, we introduce TCM-5CEval, a more granular and comprehensive benchmark. TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT). We conducted a thorough evaluation of fifteen prominent LLMs, revealing significant performance disparities and identifying top-performing models like deepseek\_r1 and gemini\_2\_5\_pro. Our findings show that while models exhibit proficiency in recalling foundational knowledge, they struggle with the interpretative complexities of classical texts. Critically, permutation-based consistency testing reveals widespread fragilities in model inference. All evaluated models, including the highest-scoring ones, displayed a substantial performance degradation when faced with varied question option ordering, indicating a pervasive sensitivity to positional bias and a lack of robust understanding. TCM-5CEval not only provides a more detailed diagnostic tool for LLM capabilities in TCM but aldso exposes fundamental weaknesses in their reasoning stability. To promote further research and standardized comparison, TCM-5CEval has been uploaded to the Medbench platform, joining its predecessor in the ""In-depth Challenge for Comprehensive TCM Abilities"" special track.",human
"Achieving pixel-level registration between SAR and optical images remains a challenging task due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms and visual characteristics. Although deep learning has achieved great success in many cross-modal tasks, its performance on SAR-Optical registration tasks is still unsatisfactory. Gradient-based information has traditionally played a crucial role in handcrafted descriptors by highlighting structural differences. However, such gradient cues have not been effectively leveraged in deep learning frameworks for SAR-Optical image matching. To address this gap, we propose SOMA, a dense registration framework that integrates structural gradient priors into deep features and refines alignment through a hybrid matching strategy. Specifically, we introduce the Feature Gradient Enhancer (FGE), which embeds multi-scale, multi-directional gradient filters into the feature space using attention and reconstruction mechanisms to boost feature distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose the Global-Local Affine-Flow Matcher (GLAM), which combines affine transformation and flow-based refinement within a coarse-to-fine architecture to ensure both structural consistency and local accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SOMA significantly improves registration precision, increasing the CMR@1px by 12.29% on the SEN1-2 dataset and 18.50% on the GFGE_SO dataset. In addition, SOMA exhibits strong robustness and generalizes well across diverse scenes and resolutions.",human
"To leverage user behavior data from the Internet more effectively in recommender systems, this paper proposes a novel collaborative filtering (CF) method called Local Collaborative Filtering (LCF). LCF utilizes local similarities among users and integrates their data using the law of large numbers (LLN), thereby improving the utilization of user behavior data. Experiments are conducted on the Steam game dataset, and the results of LCF align with real-world needs.",human
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in graph-based learning tasks, but their complex, non-linear operations often render them as opaque ""black boxes"". This opacity hinders user trust, complicates debugging, bias detection, and adoption in critical domains requiring explainability. This paper introduces InteractiveGNNExplainer, a visual analytics framework to enhance GNN explainability, focusing on node classification. Our system uniquely integrates coordinated interactive views (dynamic graph layouts, embedding projections, feature inspection, neighborhood analysis) with established post-hoc (GNNExplainer) and intrinsic (GAT attention) explanation techniques. Crucially, it incorporates interactive graph editing, allowing users to perform a ""what-if"" analysis by perturbing graph structures and observing immediate impacts on GNN predictions and explanations. We detail the system architecture and, through case studies on Cora and CiteSeer datasets, demonstrate how InteractiveGNNExplainer facilitates in-depth misclassification diagnosis, comparative analysis of GCN versus GAT behaviors, and rigorous probing of model sensitivity. These capabilities foster a deeper, multifaceted understanding of GNN predictions, contributing to more transparent, trustworthy, and robust graph analysis.",human
"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, contain a critical ambiguity: word-word repetitions can be either Repetition Disfluency (unintentional ASR error/hesitation) or Morphological Reduplication (a deliberate grammatical construct). Standard disfluency correction fails by erroneously deleting valid linguistic information. To solve this, we introduce the first publicly available, 20,000-row Bangla corpus, manually annotated to explicitly distinguish between these two phenomena in noisy ASR transcripts. We benchmark this novel resource using two paradigms: state-of-the-art multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) and task-specific fine-tuning of encoder models. LLMs achieve competitive performance (up to 82.68\% accuracy) with few-shot prompting. However, fine-tuning proves superior, with the language-specific BanglaBERT model achieving the highest accuracy of 84.78\% and an F1 score of 0.677. This establishes a strong, linguistically-informed baseline and provides essential data for developing sophisticated, semantic-preserving text normalization systems for Bangla.",human
"Grammar competency estimation is essential for assessing linguistic proficiency in both written and spoken language; however, the spoken modality presents additional challenges due to its spontaneous, unstructured, and disfluent nature. Developing accurate grammar scoring models further requires extensive expert annotation, making large-scale data creation impractical. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot grammar competency estimation framework that leverages unlabeled data and Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on manual labels. During training, we employ LLM-generated predictions on unlabeled data by using grammar competency rubric-based prompts. These predictions, treated as pseudo labels, are utilized to train a transformer-based model through a novel training framework designed to handle label noise effectively. We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy. Finally, a qualitative analysis of error intensity and score prediction confirms the robustness and interpretability of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in estimating grammar competency scores with high accuracy, paving the way for scalable, low-resource grammar assessment systems.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning techniques not only improve the adaptability to diverse downstream tasks, but also mitigate adverse effects of model quantization. Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions.",human
"The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded Americas infrastructure condition as a C, with the road system receiving a dismal D. Roads are vital to regional economic viability, yet their management, maintenance, and repair processes remain inefficient, relying on outdated manual or laser-based inspection methods that are both costly and time-consuming. With the increasing availability of real-time visual data from autonomous vehicles, there is an opportunity to apply computer vision (CV) methods for advanced road monitoring, providing insights to guide infrastructure rehabilitation efforts. This project explores the use of state-of-the-art CV techniques for road distress segmentation. It begins by evaluating synthetic data generated with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to assess its usefulness for model training. The study then applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for road distress segmentation and subsequently examines the transformer-based model MaskFormer. Results show that GAN-generated data improves model performance and that MaskFormer outperforms the CNN model in two metrics: mAP50 and IoU.",human
"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training across decentralized data, but faces key challenges of bidirectional communication overhead and client-side data heterogeneity. To address communication costs while embracing data heterogeneity, we propose pFed1BS, a novel personalized federated learning framework that achieves extreme communication compression through one-bit random sketching. In personalized FL, the goal shifts from training a single global model to creating tailored models for each client. In our framework, clients transmit highly compressed one-bit sketches, and the server aggregates and broadcasts a global one-bit consensus. To enable effective personalization, we introduce a sign-based regularizer that guides local models to align with the global consensus while preserving local data characteristics. To mitigate the computational burden of random sketching, we employ the Fast Hadamard Transform for efficient projection. Theoretical analysis guarantees that our algorithm converges to a stationary neighborhood of the global potential function. Numerical simulations demonstrate that pFed1BS substantially reduces communication costs while achieving competitive performance compared to advanced communication-efficient FL algorithms.",human
"Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models by implanting hidden vulnerabilities that can be activated by malicious inputs. While numerous defenses have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, the heterogeneous landscape of evaluation methodologies hinders fair comparison between defenses. This work presents a systematic (meta-)analysis of backdoor defenses through a comprehensive literature review and empirical evaluation. We analyzed 183 backdoor defense papers published between 2018 and 2025 across major AI and security venues, examining the properties and evaluation methodologies of these defenses.   Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in experimental setups, evaluation metrics, and threat model assumptions in the literature. Through extensive experiments involving three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), four model architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-19, ViT-B/16, DenseNet-121), 16 representative defenses, and five commonly used attacks, totaling over 3\,000 experiments, we demonstrate that defense effectiveness varies substantially across different evaluation setups. We identify critical gaps in current evaluation practices, including insufficient reporting of computational overhead and behavior under benign conditions, bias in hyperparameter selection, and incomplete experimentation. Based on our findings, we provide concrete challenges and well-motivated recommendations to standardize and improve future defense evaluations. Our work aims to equip researchers and industry practitioners with actionable insights for developing, assessing, and deploying defenses to different systems.",human
"Task decomposition has shown promise in complex cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, which enables efficient hierarchical learning for long-horizon tasks in dynamic and uncertain environments. However, learning dynamic task decomposition from scratch generally requires a large number of training samples, especially exploring the large joint action space under partial observability. In this paper, we present the Conditional Diffusion Model for Dynamic Task Decomposition (C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T), a novel two-level hierarchical MARL framework designed to automatically infer subtask and coordination patterns. The high-level policy learns subtask representation to generate a subtask selection strategy based on subtask effects. To capture the effects of subtasks on the environment, C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T predicts the next observation and reward using a conditional diffusion model. At the low level, agents collaboratively learn and share specialized skills within their assigned subtasks. Moreover, the learned subtask representation is also used as additional semantic information in a multi-head attention mixing network to enhance value decomposition and provide an efficient reasoning bridge between individual and joint value functions. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T achieves better performance than existing baselines.",human
"Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) seeks to learn a unified policy for diverse tasks, but often suffers from gradient conflicts across tasks. Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.   To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance.",human
"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents have made remarkable progress, but their robustness remains insufficiently studied. Existing adversarial evaluations often rely on perturbations that manifest as unusual textures rarely encountered in everyday indoor environments. Errors under such contrived conditions have limited practical relevance, as real-world agents are unlikely to encounter such artificial patterns. In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations.",human
"Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex reasoning and decision-making tasks. In telecommunications, they hold the potential to transform network optimization, automate troubleshooting, enhance customer support, and ensure regulatory compliance. However, their deployment in telecom is hindered by domain-specific challenges that demand specialized adaptation. To overcome these challenges and to accelerate the adaptation of LLMs for telecom, we propose MM-Telco, a comprehensive suite of multimodal benchmarks and models tailored for the telecom domain. The benchmark introduces various tasks (both text based and image based) that address various practical real-life use cases such as network operations, network management, improving documentation quality, and retrieval of relevant text and images. Further, we perform baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. The models fine-tuned on our dataset exhibit a significant boost in performance. Our experiments also help analyze the weak areas in the working of current state-of-art multimodal LLMs, thus guiding towards further development and research.",human
"This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of recurrent and attention-based neural architectures for isolated sign language recognition. We implement and evaluate two representative models-ConvLSTM and Vanilla Transformer-on the Azerbaijani Sign Language Dataset (AzSLD) and the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) dataset. Our results demonstrate that the attention-based Vanilla Transformer consistently outperforms the recurrent ConvLSTM in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy across datasets, achieving up to 76.8% Top-1 accuracy on AzSLD and 88.3% on WLASL. The ConvLSTM, while more computationally efficient, lags in recognition accuracy, particularly on smaller datasets. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of each paradigm: the Transformer excels in overall accuracy and signer independence, whereas the ConvLSTM offers advantages in computational efficiency and temporal modeling. The study provides a nuanced analysis of these trade-offs, offering guidance for architecture selection in sign language recognition systems depending on application requirements and resource constraints.",human
"Recent learning-based methods have reduced the computational complexity of traditional trajectory similarity computation, but state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods still fail to leverage the comprehensive spectrum of trajectory information for similarity modeling. To tackle this problem, we propose \textbf{RePo}, a novel method that jointly encodes \textbf{Re}gion-wise and \textbf{Po}int-wise features to capture both spatial context and fine-grained moving patterns. For region-wise representation, the GPS trajectories are first mapped to grid sequences, and spatial context are captured by structural features and semantic context enriched by visual features. For point-wise representation, three lightweight expert networks extract local, correlation, and continuous movement patterns from dense GPS sequences. Then, a router network adaptively fuses the learned point-wise features, which are subsequently combined with region-wise features using cross-attention to produce the final trajectory embedding. To train RePo, we adopt a contrastive loss with hard negative samples to provide similarity ranking supervision. Experiment results show that RePo achieves an average accuracy improvement of 22.2\% over SOTA baselines across all evaluation metrics.",human
"Predicting single-cell perturbation outcomes directly advances gene function analysis and facilitates drug candidate selection, making it a key driver of both basic and translational biomedical research. However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity. Experiments on public genetic and drug perturbation datasets show that our model effectively captures heterogeneous single-cell responses and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",human
"Zero-shot event extraction (ZSEE) remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for complex reasoning and domain-specific understanding. Direct prompting often yields incomplete or structurally invalid outputs--such as misclassified triggers, missing arguments, and schema violations. To address these limitations, we present Agent-Event-Coder (AEC), a novel multi-agent framework that treats event extraction like software engineering: as a structured, iterative code-generation process. AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings. Experiments across five diverse domains and six LLMs demonstrate that AEC consistently outperforms prior zero-shot baselines, showcasing the power of treating event extraction like code generation. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/Agent-Event-Coder.",human
"Machine unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of specific data from trained models to ensure privacy compliance. However, most existing methods assume full access to the original training dataset, which is often impractical. We address a more realistic yet challenging setting: few-shot zero-glance, where only a small subset of the retained data is available and the forget set is entirely inaccessible. We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure. GFN synthesises Optimal Erasure Samples (OES), which induce high loss on target classes, enabling the model to forget class-specific knowledge without access to the original forget data, while preserving performance on retained classes. The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second. Experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that GFOES achieves effective forgetting at both logit and representation levels, while maintaining strong performance using only 5% of the original data. Our framework offers a practical and scalable solution for privacy-preserving machine learning under data-constrained conditions.",human
"Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.   We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.",human
"The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement is the global benchmark for transparent and high-quality reporting of randomized controlled trials. Manual verification of CONSORT adherence is a laborious, time-intensive process that constitutes a significant bottleneck in peer review and evidence synthesis. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the accuracy and reliability of contemporary LLMs in identifying the adherence of published RCTs to the CONSORT 2010 statement under a zero-shot setting. We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis. Overall model performance was modest. The top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Flash and DeepSeek-R1, achieved nearly identical macro F1 scores of 0.634 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients of 0.280 and 0.282, respectively, indicating only fair agreement with expert consensus. A striking performance disparity was observed across classes: while most models could identify compliant items with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.850), they struggled profoundly with identifying non-compliant and not applicable items, where F1 scores rarely exceeded 0.400. Notably, some high-profile models like GPT-4o underperformed, achieving a macro F1-score of only 0.521. LLMs show potential as preliminary screening assistants for CONSORT checks, capably identifying well-reported items. However, their current inability to reliably detect reporting omissions or methodological flaws makes them unsuitable for replacing human expertise in the critical appraisal of trial quality.",human
"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for large-scale network control, yet existing methods face two major limitations. First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.",human
"We introduce BeDiscovER (Benchmark of Discourse Understanding in the Era of Reasoning Language Models), an up-to-date, comprehensive suite for evaluating the discourse-level knowledge of modern LLMs. BeDiscovER compiles 5 publicly available discourse tasks across discourse lexicon, (multi-)sentential, and documental levels, with in total 52 individual datasets. It covers both extensively studied tasks such as discourse parsing and temporal relation extraction, as well as some novel challenges such as discourse particle disambiguation (e.g., ``just''), and also aggregates a shared task on Discourse Relation Parsing and Treebanking for multilingual and multi-framework discourse relation classification. We evaluate open-source LLMs: Qwen3 series, DeepSeek-R1, and frontier model such as GPT-5-mini on BeDiscovER, and find that state-of-the-art models exhibit strong performance in arithmetic aspect of temporal reasoning, but they struggle with full document reasoning and some subtle semantic and discourse phenomena, such as rhetorical relation recognition.",human
"Multi-turn interaction remains challenging for online reinforcement learning. A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget.",human
"Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding - the task of mapping natural language instructions to screen coordinates - is essential for autonomous agents and accessibility technologies. Existing systems rely on monolithic models or one-shot pipelines that lack modularity and fail under visual clutter and ambiguous instructions. We introduce MEGA-GUI, a multi-stage framework that separates grounding into coarse Region-of-Interest (ROI) selection and fine-grained element grounding, orchestrated by specialized vision-language agents. MEGA-GUI features a bidirectional ROI zoom algorithm that mitigates spatial dilution and a context-aware rewriting agent that reduces semantic ambiguity. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths and weaknesses across vision-language models at different visual scales, and we show that leveraging this modular structure achieves consistently higher accuracy than monolithic approaches. On the visually dense ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, MEGA-GUI attains 73.18% accuracy, and on the semantically complex OSWorld-G benchmark it reaches 68.63%, surpassing previously reported results. Code and the Grounding Benchmark Toolkit (GBT) are available at https://github.com/samsungsds-research-papers/mega-gui.",human
"Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial, enabling the establishment of appropriate treatment plans and markedly enhancing patient prognosis. While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.",human
"Saliency maps are widely used for visual explanations in deep learning, but a fundamental lack of consensus persists regarding their intended purpose and alignment with diverse user queries. This ambiguity hinders the effective evaluation and practical utility of explanation methods. We address this gap by introducing the Reference-Frame $\times$ Granularity (RFxG) taxonomy, a principled conceptual framework that organizes saliency explanations along two essential axes:Reference-Frame: Distinguishing between pointwise (""Why this prediction?"") and contrastive (""Why this and not an alternative?"") explanations. Granularity: Ranging from fine-grained class-level (e.g., ""Why Husky?"") to coarse-grained group-level (e.g., ""Why Dog?"") interpretations. Using the RFxG lens, we demonstrate critical limitations in existing evaluation metrics, which overwhelmingly prioritize pointwise faithfulness while neglecting contrastive reasoning and semantic granularity. To systematically assess explanation quality across both RFxG dimensions, we propose four novel faithfulness metrics. Our comprehensive evaluation framework applies these metrics to ten state-of-the-art saliency methods, four model architectures, and three datasets. By advocating a shift toward user-intent-driven evaluation, our work provides both the conceptual foundation and the practical tools necessary to develop visual explanations that are not only faithful to the underlying model behavior but are also meaningfully aligned with the complexity of human understanding and inquiry.",human
"Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) operate in high-pressure environments, making rapid, life-critical decisions under heavy cognitive and operational loads. We present EMSGlass, a smart-glasses system powered by EMSNet, the first multimodal multitask model for Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and EMSServe, a low-latency multimodal serving framework tailored to EMS scenarios. EMSNet integrates text, vital signs, and scene images to construct a unified real-time understanding of EMS incidents. Trained on real-world multimodal EMS datasets, EMSNet simultaneously supports up to five critical EMS tasks with superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art unimodal baselines. Built on top of PyTorch, EMSServe introduces a modality-aware model splitter and a feature caching mechanism, achieving adaptive and efficient inference across heterogeneous hardware while addressing the challenge of asynchronous modality arrival in the field. By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves 1.9x -- 11.7x speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference. A user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction. In addition, qualitative insights from the user study provide actionable directions for extending EMSGlass toward next-generation AI-enabled EMS systems, bridging multimodal intelligence with real-world emergency response workflows.",human
"Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.",human
"Low-cost micro-electromechanical accelerometers are widely used in navigation, robotics, and consumer devices for motion sensing and position estimation. However, their performance is often degraded by bias errors. To eliminate deterministic bias terms a calibration procedure is applied under stationary conditions. It requires accelerom- eter leveling or complex orientation-dependent calibration procedures. To overcome those requirements, in this paper we present a model-free learning-based calibration method that estimates accelerometer bias under stationary conditions, without requiring knowledge of the sensor orientation and without the need to rotate the sensors. The proposed approach provides a fast, practical, and scalable solution suitable for rapid field deployment. Experimental validation on a 13.39-hour dataset collected from six accelerometers shows that the proposed method consistently achieves error levels more than 52% lower than traditional techniques. On a broader scale, this work contributes to the advancement of accurate calibration methods in orientation-free scenarios. As a consequence, it improves the reliability of low-cost inertial sensors in diverse scientific and industrial applications and eliminates the need for leveled calibration.",human
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.",human
"Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental operation in the inference of sparse Large Language Models (LLMs). Because existing SpMV methods perform poorly under the low and unstructured sparsity (30-90%) commonly observed in pruned LLMs, unstructured pruning provided only limited memory reduction and speedup. We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision. Thanks to MACKO, unstructured pruning at 50% sparsity is now justified in real-world LLM workloads.",human
"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed a major global health challenge for decades, and forecasting HIV diagnoses continues to be a critical area of research. However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.",human
"Online decision systems routinely operate under delayed feedback and order-sensitive (noncommutative) dynamics: actions affect which observations arrive, and in what sequence. Taking a Bregman divergence $D_Φ$ as the loss benchmark, we prove that the excess benchmark loss admits a structured lower bound $L \ge L_{\mathrm{ideal}} + g_1(λ) + g_2(\varepsilon_\star) + g_{12}(λ,\varepsilon_\star) - D_{\mathrm{ncx}}$, where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are calibrated penalties for latency and order-sensitivity, $g_{12}$ captures their geometric interaction, and $D_{\mathrm{ncx}}\ge 0$ is a nonconvexity/approximation penalty that vanishes under convex Legendre assumptions. We extend this inequality to prox-regular and weakly convex settings, obtaining robust guarantees beyond the convex case. We also give an operational recipe for estimating and monitoring the four terms via simple $2\times 2$ randomized experiments and streaming diagnostics (effective sample size, clipping rate, interaction heatmaps). The framework packages heterogeneous latency, noncommutativity, and implementation-gap effects into a single interpretable lower-bound statement that can be stress-tested and tuned in real-world systems.",human
"Dense retrieval models have become a standard for state-of-the-art information retrieval. However, their high-dimensional, high-precision (float32) vector embeddings create significant storage and memory challenges for real-world deployment. To address this, we conduct a rigorous empirical study on the BEIR SciFact benchmark, evaluating the trade-offs between two primary compression strategies: (1) Dimensionality Reduction via deep Autoencoders (AE), reducing original 384-dim vectors to latent spaces from 384 down to 12, and (2) Precision Reduction via Quantization (float16, int8, and binary). We systematically compare each method by measuring the ""performance loss"" (or gain) relative to a float32 baseline across a full suite of retrieval metrics (NDCG, MAP, MRR, Recall, Precision) at various k cutoffs. Our results show that int8 scalar quantization provides the most effective ""sweet spot,"" achieving a 4x compression with a negligible [~1-2%] drop in nDCG@10. In contrast, Autoencoders show a graceful degradation but suffer a more significant performance loss at equivalent 4x compression ratios (AE-96). binary quantization was found to be unsuitable for this task due to catastrophic performance drops. This work provides a practical guide for deploying efficient, high-performance retrieval systems.",human
"Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by unifying the geometric analysis of the attractor landscape with the spectral theory of kernel machines. Using a novel metric, ""Pinnacle Sharpness,"" we first uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor stability, identifying a ""Ridge of Optimization"" where the network achieves maximal robustness under high-load conditions. Phenomenologically, this ridge is characterized by a ""Force Antagonism,"" where a strong driving force is balanced by a collective feedback force. Theoretically, we reveal that this phenomenon arises from a specific reorganization of the weight spectrum, which we term \textit{Spectral Concentration}. Unlike a simple rank-1 collapse, our analysis shows that the network on the ridge self-organizes into a critical state: the leading eigenvalue is amplified to maximize global stability (Direct Force), while the trailing eigenvalues are preserved to maintain high memory capacity (Indirect Force). These findings provide a complete physical picture of how high-capacity associative memories are formed, demonstrating that optimal performance is achieved by tuning the system to a spectral ""Goldilocks zone"" between rank collapse and diffusion.",human
"Language models (LMs) are often adapted through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to specialize their capabilities for downstream tasks. However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to ""undesirable"" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects.",human
"We study a matrix completion problem where both the ground truth $R$ matrix and the unknown sampling distribution $P$ over observed entries are low-rank matrices, and \textit{share a common subspace}. We assume that a large amount $M$ of \textit{unlabeled} data drawn from the sampling distribution $P$ is available, together with a small amount $N$ of labeled data drawn from the same distribution and noisy estimates of the corresponding ground truth entries. This setting is inspired by recommender systems scenarios where the unlabeled data corresponds to `implicit feedback' (consisting in interactions such as purchase, click, etc. ) and the labeled data corresponds to the `explicit feedback', consisting of interactions where the user has given an explicit rating to the item. Leveraging powerful results from the theory of low-rank subspace recovery, together with classic generalization bounds for matrix completion models, we show error bounds consisting of a sum of two error terms scaling as $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{nd}{M}}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{dr}{N}}\right)$ respectively, where $d$ is the rank of $P$ and $r$ is the rank of $M$. In synthetic experiments, we confirm that the true generalization error naturally splits into independent error terms corresponding to the estimations of $P$ and and the ground truth matrix $\ground$ respectively. In real-life experiments on Douban and MovieLens with most explicit ratings removed, we demonstrate that the method can outperform baselines relying only on the explicit ratings, demonstrating that our assumptions provide a valid toy theoretical setting to study the interaction between explicit and implicit feedbacks in recommender systems.",human
"Traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods require large amounts of data to perform well, limiting their applicability in sparse or incomplete scenarios and forcing the usage of additional synthetic data to improve the model training. To overcome this challenge, the research community is looking more and more at Graph Machine Learning (GML) as it offers a powerful alternative by using relationships within data. However, this method also faces limitations, particularly when dealing with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can hide huge information due to their semantic nature. This study introduces Bi-View, a novel hybrid approach that increases the informative content of node features in KGs to generate enhanced Graph Embeddings (GEs) that are used to improve GML models without relying on additional synthetic data. The proposed work combines two complementary GE techniques: Node2Vec, which captures structural patterns through unsupervised random walks, and GraphSAGE, which aggregates neighbourhood information in a supervised way. Node2Vec embeddings are first computed to represent the graph topology, and node features are then enriched with centrality-based metrics, which are used as input for the GraphSAGE model. Moreover, a fusion layer combines the original Node2Vec embeddings with the GraphSAGE-influenced representations, resulting in a dual-perspective embedding space. Such a fusion captures both topological and semantic properties of the graph, enabling the model to exploit informative features that may exist in the dataset but that are not explicitly represented. Our approach improves downstream task performance, especially in scenarios with poor initial features, giving the basis for more accurate and precise KG-enanched GML models.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in automated theorem proving, yet progress is often constrained by the scarcity of diverse and high-quality formal language data. To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a ""CoT-augmented state prediction"" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems. Experimental results demonstrate that Spark-Prover achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized open-source models within the ""Whole-Proof Generation"" paradigm. It shows exceptional performance on difficult competition benchmarks, notably solving 27 problems on PutnamBench (pass@32) and achieving 24.0\% on CombiBench (pass@32). Our work validates that this diverse training data and progressively refined training pipeline provides an effective path for enhancing the formal reasoning capabilities of lightweight LLMs. Both Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B, along with the ExamFormal-Bench dataset, are made publicly available at: https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/iflytek, https://gitcode.com/ifly_opensource.",human
"Sans a dwindling number of monolingual embedding studies originating predominantly from the low-resource domains, it is evident that multilingual embedding has become the de facto choice due to its adaptability to the usage of code-mixed languages, granting the ability to process multilingual documents in a language-agnostic manner, as well as removing the difficult task of aligning monolingual embeddings. But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models. Often, combined embedding alignment techniques perform better while in certain cases multilingual embeddings perform better (mainly low-resource language cases).",human
"We introduce a one-step generative policy for offline reinforcement learning that maps noise directly to actions via a residual reformulation of MeanFlow, making it compatible with Q-learning. While one-step Gaussian policies enable fast inference, they struggle to capture complex, multimodal action distributions. Existing flow-based methods improve expressivity but typically rely on distillation and two-stage training when trained with Q-learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate MeanFlow to enable direct noise-to-action generation by integrating the velocity field and noise-to-action transformation into a single policy network-eliminating the need for separate velocity estimation. We explore several reformulation variants and identify an effective residual formulation that supports expressive and stable policy learning. Our method offers three key advantages: 1) efficient one-step noise-to-action generation, 2) expressive modelling of multimodal action distributions, and 3) efficient and stable policy learning via Q-learning in a single-stage training setup. Extensive experiments on 73 tasks across the OGBench and D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance in both offline and offline-to-online reinforcement learning settings.

"Existing language model evaluations primarily measure general capabilities, yet reliable use of these models across a range of domains demands factual accuracy and recognition of knowledge gaps. We introduce AA-Omniscience, a benchmark designed to measure both factual recall and knowledge calibration across 6,000 questions. Questions are derived from authoritative academic and industry sources, and cover 42 economically relevant topics within six different domains. The evaluation measures a model's Omniscience Index, a bounded metric (-100 to 100) measuring factual recall that jointly penalizes hallucinations and rewards abstention when uncertain, with 0 equating to a model that answers questions correctly as much as it does incorrectly. Among evaluated models, Claude 4.1 Opus attains the highest score (4.8), making it one of only three models to score above zero. These results reveal persistent factuality and calibration weaknesses across frontier models. Performance also varies by domain, with the models from three different research labs leading across the six domains. This performance variability suggests models should be chosen according to the demands of the use case rather than general performance for tasks where knowledge is important.",human
"Large language models have achieved remarkable success on final-answer mathematical problems, largely due to the ease of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. However, the reasoning underlying these solutions is often flawed. Advancing to rigorous proof-based mathematics requires reliable proof verification capabilities. We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity. Our results establish practical guidelines for designing and evaluating scalable proof-verification and selection systems.",human
"We consider the problem of reconstructing the intrinsic geometry of a manifold from noisy pairwise distance observations. Specifically, let $M$ denote a diameter 1 d-dimensional manifold and $μ$ a probability measure on $M$ that is mutually absolutely continuous with the volume measure. Suppose $X_1,\dots,X_N$ are i.i.d. samples of $μ$ and we observe noisy-distance random variables $d'(X_j, X_k)$ that are related to the true geodesic distances $d(X_j,X_k)$. With mild assumptions on the distributions and independence of the noisy distances, we develop a new framework for recovering all distances between points in a sufficiently dense subsample of $M$. Our framework improves on previous work which assumed i.i.d. additive noise with known moments. Our method is based on a new way to estimate $L_2$-norms of certain expectation-functions $f_x(y)=\mathbb{E}d'(x,y)$ and use them to build robust clusters centered at points of our sample. Using a new geometric argument, we establish that, under mild geometric assumptions--bounded curvature and positive injectivity radius--these clusters allow one to recover the true distances between points in the sample up to an additive error of $O(\varepsilon \log \varepsilon^{-1})$. We develop two distinct algorithms for producing these clusters. The first achieves a sample complexity $N \asymp \varepsilon^{-2d-2}\log(1/\varepsilon)$ and runtime $o(N^3)$. The second introduces novel geometric ideas that warrant further investigation. In the presence of missing observations, we show that a quantitative lower bound on sampling probabilities suffices to modify the cluster construction in the first algorithm and extend all recovery guarantees. Our main technical result also elucidates which properties of a manifold are necessary for the distance recovery, which suggests further extension of our techniques to a broader class of metric probability spaces.",human
"Despite the growing interest in Small Language Models (SLMs) as resource-efficient alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to unresolved efficiency gaps in model compression. While quantization has proven effective for LLMs, its applicability to SLMs is significantly underexplored, with critical questions about differing quantization bottlenecks and efficiency profiles. This paper introduces SLMQuant, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM compression techniques when applied to SLMs. Through comprehensive multi-track evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks, we analyze how state-of-the-art quantization methods perform on SLMs. Our findings reveal fundamental disparities between SLMs and LLMs in quantization sensitivity, demonstrating that direct transfer of LLM-optimized techniques leads to suboptimal results due to SLMs' unique architectural characteristics and training dynamics. We identify key factors governing effective SLM quantization and propose actionable design principles for SLM-tailored compression. SLMQuant establishes a foundational framework for advancing efficient SLM deployment on low-end devices in edge applications, and provides critical insights for deploying lightweight language models in resource-constrained scenarios.",human
"General-purpose foundation models for neural time series can help accelerate neuroscientific discoveries and enable applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). A key component in scaling these models is population-level representation learning, which leverages information across channels to capture spatial as well as temporal structure. Population-level approaches have recently shown that such representations can be both efficient to learn on top of pretrained temporal encoders and produce useful representations for decoding a variety of downstream tasks. However, these models remain sensitive to mismatches in preprocessing, particularly on time-scales, between pretraining and downstream settings. We systematically examine how time-scale mismatches affects generalization and find that existing representations lack invariance. To address this, we introduce Time-scale Augmented Pretraining (TSAP), which consistently improves robustness to different time-scales across decoding tasks and builds invariance in the representation space. These results highlight handling preprocessing diversity as a key step toward building generalizable neural foundation models.",human
"Real-world conversations are rich with pragmatic elements, such as entity mentions, references, and implicatures. Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers.",human
"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) holds great potential for healthcare due to its rich spectral information. However, acquiring HSI data remains costly and technically demanding. Hyperspectral image reconstruction offers a practical solution by recovering HSI data from accessible modalities, such as RGB. While general domain datasets are abundant, the scarcity of human HSI data limits progress in medical applications. To tackle this, we propose SpectralAdapt, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that bridges the domain gap between general and human-centered HSI datasets. To fully exploit limited labels and abundant unlabeled data, we enhance spectral reasoning by introducing Spectral Density Masking (SDM), which adaptively masks RGB channels based on their spectral complexity, encouraging recovery of informative regions from complementary cues during consistency training. Furthermore, we introduce Spectral Endmember Representation Alignment (SERA), which derives physically interpretable endmembers from valuable labeled pixels and employs them as domain-invariant anchors to guide unlabeled predictions, with momentum updates ensuring adaptability and stability. These components are seamlessly integrated into SpectralAdapt, a spectral prior-guided framework that effectively mitigates domain shift, spectral degradation, and data scarcity in HSI reconstruction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity, cross-domain generalization, and training stability, highlighting the promise of SSDA as an efficient solution for hyperspectral imaging in healthcare.",human
"MeanFlow (MF) is a diffusion-motivated generative model that enables efficient few-step generation by learning long jumps directly from noise to data. In practice, it is often used as a latent MF by leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for high-dimensional data modeling. However, MF training remains computationally demanding and is often unstable. During inference, the SD-VAE decoder dominates the generation cost, and MF depends on complex guidance hyperparameters for class-conditional generation. In this work, we develop an efficient training and sampling scheme for MF in the latent space of a Representation Autoencoder (RAE), where a pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., DINO) provides semantically rich latents paired with a lightweight decoder. We observe that naive MF training in the RAE latent space suffers from severe gradient explosion. To stabilize and accelerate training, we adopt Consistency Mid-Training for trajectory-aware initialization and use a two-stage scheme: distillation from a pre-trained flow matching teacher to speed convergence and reduce variance, followed by an optional bootstrapping stage with a one-point velocity estimator to further reduce deviation from the oracle mean flow. This design removes the need for guidance, simplifies training configurations, and reduces computation in both training and sampling. Empirically, our method achieves a 1-step FID of 2.03, outperforming vanilla MF's 3.43, while reducing sampling GFLOPS by 38% and total training cost by 83% on ImageNet 256. We further scale our approach to ImageNet 512, achieving a competitive 1-step FID of 3.23 with the lowest GFLOPS among all baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/sony/mf-rae.",human
"The R-Learner is a powerful, theoretically-grounded framework for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, prized for its robustness to nuisance model errors. However, its application to network data, where causal heterogeneity is often graph-dependent, presents a critical challenge to its core assumption of a well-specified final-stage model. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to systematically dissect the R-Learner framework on graphs. We provide the first rigorous evidence that the primary driver of performance is the inductive bias of the final-stage CATE estimator, an effect that dominates the choice of nuisance models. Our central finding is the quantification of a catastrophic ""representation bottleneck"": we prove with overwhelming statistical significance (p < 0.001) that R-Learners with a graph-blind final stage fail completely (MSE > 4.0), even when paired with powerful GNN nuisance models. Conversely, our proposed end-to-end Graph R-Learner succeeds and significantly outperforms a strong, non-DML GNN T-Learner baseline. Furthermore, we identify and provide a mechanistic explanation for a subtle, topology-dependent ""nuisance bottleneck,"" linking it to GNN over-squashing via a targeted ""Hub-Periphery Trade-off"" analysis. Our findings are validated across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. We release our code as a reproducible benchmark to facilitate future research on this critical ""final-stage bottleneck.""",human

"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.",human
"Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on supervised reward models or external judges that demand abundant annotations. However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data.",human
"Large vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown strong zero-shot classification performance by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space. However, CLIP models often develop multimodal spurious biases, which is the undesirable tendency to rely on spurious features. For example, CLIP may infer object types in images based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than the object's core features. This bias significantly impairs the robustness of pre-trained CLIP models on out-of-distribution data, where such cross-modal associations no longer hold. Existing methods for mitigating multimodal spurious bias typically require fine-tuning on downstream data or prior knowledge of the bias, which undermines the out-of-the-box usability of CLIP. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the impact of multimodal spurious bias in zero-shot classification. Based on this insight, we propose Spuriousness-Aware Guided Exploration (SAGE), a simple and effective method that mitigates spurious bias through guided prompt selection. SAGE requires no training, fine-tuning, or external annotations. It explores a space of prompt templates and selects the prompts that induce the largest semantic separation between classes, thereby improving worst-group robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets and five popular backbone models demonstrate that SAGE consistently improves zero-shot performance and generalization, outperforming previous zero-shot approaches without any external knowledge or model updates.",human
"Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.",human
"Multimodal LLM-powered agents have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in web navigation, enabling agents to complete complex browsing tasks across diverse domains. However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps. Notably, smaller base models with WebCoach achieve performance comparable to the same web agent using GPT-4o.",human
"Lead (Pb) is a typical low-melting-point ductile metal and serves as an important model material in the study of dynamic responses. Under shock-wave loading, its dynamic mechanical behavior comprises two key phenomena: plastic deformation and shock induced phase transitions. The underlying mechanisms of these processes are still poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms remains challenging for experimental approaches. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are an alternative theoretical tool for studying dynamic responses, as they capture atomic-scale mechanisms such as defect evolution and deformation pathways. However, due to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials, the reliability of previous NEMD studies is questioned. Using our newly developed machine learning potential for Pb-Sn alloys, we revisited the microstructure evolution in response to shock loading under various shock orientations. The results reveal that shock loading along the [001] orientation of Pb exhibits a fast, reversible, and massive phase transition and stacking fault evolution. The behavior of Pb differs from previous studies by the absence of twinning during plastic deformation. Loading along the [011] orientation leads to slow, irreversible plastic deformation, and a localized FCC-BCC phase transition in the Pitsch orientation relationship. This study provides crucial theoretical insights into the dynamic mechanical response of Pb, offering a theoretical input for understanding the microstructure-performance relationship under extreme conditions.",human
"The honesty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important for safe deployment in high-stakes domains. However, this crucial trait is severely undermined by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), a common technique for model specialization. Existing recovery methods rely on data-intensive global parameter adjustments, implicitly assuming that SFT deeply corrupts the models' ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries. However, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs still preserve this ability; what is damaged is their capacity to faithfully express that awareness. Building on this, we propose Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR) to surgically repair this suppressed capacity. HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation. Experiments on four QA tasks and five LLM families demonstrate that HCNR effectively recovers 33.25% of the compromised honesty while achieving at least 2.23x speedup with over 10x less data compared to baseline methods, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.",human
"The growing scale of datasets in deep learning has introduced significant computational challenges. Dataset pruning addresses this challenge by constructing a compact but informative coreset from the full dataset with comparable performance. Previous approaches typically establish scoring metrics based on specific criteria to identify representative samples. However, these methods predominantly rely on sample scores obtained from the model's performance during the training (i.e., fitting) phase. As scoring models achieve near-optimal performance on training data, such fitting-centric approaches induce a dense distribution of sample scores within a narrow numerical range. This concentration reduces the distinction between samples and hinders effective selection. To address this challenge, we conduct dataset pruning from the perspective of generalization, i.e., scoring samples based on models not exposed to them during training. We propose a plug-and-play framework, UNSEEN, which can be integrated into existing dataset pruning methods. Additionally, conventional score-based methods are single-step and rely on models trained solely on the complete dataset, providing limited perspective on the importance of samples. To address this limitation, we scale UNSEEN to multi-step scenarios and propose an incremental selection technique through scoring models trained on varying coresets, and optimize the quality of the coreset dynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. Notably, on ImageNet-1K, UNSEEN achieves lossless performance while reducing training data by 30\%.",human
"Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) is the dominant exact solution method for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP), yet its exponential time complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale instances. The growing capabilities of machine learning have spurred efforts to improve B\&B by learning data-driven branching policies. However, most existing approaches rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which tends to overfit to expert demonstrations and struggles to generalize to structurally diverse or unseen instances. In this work, we propose Tree-Gate Proximal Policy Optimization (TGPPO), a novel framework that employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, to train a branching policy aimed at improving generalization across heterogeneous MILP instances. Our approach builds on a parameterized state space representation that dynamically captures the evolving context of the search tree. Empirical evaluations show that TGPPO often outperforms existing learning-based policies in terms of reducing the number of nodes explored and improving p-Primal-Dual Integrals (PDI), particularly in out-of-distribution instances. These results highlight the potential of RL to develop robust and adaptable branching strategies for MILP solvers.",human
"Adversarial examples in neural networks have been extensively studied in Euclidean geometry, but recent advances in \textit{hyperbolic networks} call for a reevaluation of attack strategies in non-Euclidean geometries. Existing methods such as FGSM and PGD apply perturbations without regard to the underlying hyperbolic structure, potentially leading to inefficient or geometrically inconsistent attacks. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings. This work highlights the importance of geometry-aware adversarial strategies in curved representation spaces and provides a principled framework for attacking hierarchical embeddings.",human
"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical paradigm for building reliable, knowledge-intensive Large Language Model (LLM) applications. However, the multi-stage pipeline (retrieve, generate) and unique workload characteristics (e.g., knowledge dependency) of RAG systems pose significant challenges for serving performance optimization. Existing generic LLM inference traces fail to capture these RAG-specific dynamics, creating a significant performance gap between academic research and real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RAGPulse, an open-source RAG workload trace dataset. This dataset was collected from an university-wide Q&A system serving that has served more than 40,000 students and faculties since April 2024. We detail RAGPulse's system architecture, its privacy-preserving hash-based data format, and provide an in-depth statistical analysis. Our analysis reveals that real-world RAG workloads exhibit significant temporal locality and a highly skewed hot document access pattern. RAGPulse provides a high-fidelity foundation for researchers to develop and validate novel optimization strategies for RAG systems, such as content-aware batching and retrieval caching, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of RAG services. The code is available at https://github.com/flashserve/RAGPulse.",human
"Most neural network quantization methods apply uniform bit precision across spatial regions, ignoring the heterogeneous structural and textural complexity of visual data. This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image. Cross-dataset validation on COCO and Pascal VOC further confirms consistent performance gains, indicating that morphology-driven spatial quantization can enhance efficiency and robustness for computationally constrained, safety-critical visual recognition tasks.",human
"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is experiencing rapid expansion. However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection.   Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches. Our large-scale study, analyzing 2,675,573 smart contracts on six EVM-compatible chains over a one-year period, also demonstrates that Esim outperforms the SOTA tool Etherscan in vulnerability search.",human
"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated high performance in image classification tasks by effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. However, existing SSL methods often suffer from poor calibration, with models yielding overconfident predictions that misrepresent actual prediction likelihoods. Recently, neural networks trained with {\tt mixup} that linearly interpolates random examples from the training set have shown better calibration in supervised settings. However, calibration of neural models remains under-explored in semi-supervised settings. Although effective in supervised model calibration, random mixup of pseudolabels in SSL presents challenges due to the overconfidence and unreliability of pseudolabels. In this work, we introduce CalibrateMix, a targeted mixup-based approach that aims to improve the calibration of SSL models while maintaining or even improving their classification accuracy. Our method leverages training dynamics of labeled and unlabeled samples to identify ``easy-to-learn'' and ``hard-to-learn'' samples, which in turn are utilized in a targeted mixup of easy and hard samples. Experimental results across several benchmark image datasets show that our method achieves lower expected calibration error (ECE) and superior accuracy compared to existing SSL approaches.",human
"We study how to impose domain-consistent structure on large language models (LLMs) used for scientific reasoning and early-stage drug discovery.

The system injects curated symbolic facts into prompts and then enforces rule satisfaction with a deterministic checker. We formalize generation as constrained inference, introduce a soft guidance surrogate suitable for decoding, and perform a thorough statistical analysis with uncertainty quantification. Across 90 tasks spanning reaction feasibility, metabolic compatibility, and toxicity screening, MedRule-KG reduces violation counts by 83.2\% relative to a strong chain-of-thought baseline while improving exact match. Results remain stable under stratification and scale with dataset size, and the verifier adds negligible latency, making the approach practical for interactive design.",human

"Multivariate time series classification is increasingly investigated in space weather research as a means to predict intense solar flare events, which can cause widespread disruptions across modern technological systems. Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks.",human
"Financial markets are inherently volatile and prone to sudden disruptions such as market crashes, flash collapses, and liquidity crises. Accurate anomaly detection and early risk forecasting in financial time series are therefore crucial for preventing systemic instability and supporting informed investment decisions. Traditional deep learning models, such as LSTM and GRU, often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex periodic patterns in highly nonstationary financial data. To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings. Experiments conducted on the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Brent Crude Oil datasets (2000-2024) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods, achieving a 15.7 percent reduction in RMSE and an 11.5 percent improvement in F1-score for anomaly detection. These results confirm the effectiveness of the model in capturing financial volatility, enabling reliable early-warning systems for market crash prediction and risk management.",human
"Time series forecasting under distribution shift remains challenging, as existing deep learning models often rely on local statistical normalization (e.g., mean and variance) that fails to capture global distribution shift. Methods like RevIN and its variants attempt to decouple distribution and pattern but still struggle with missing values, noisy observations, and invalid channel-wise affine transformation. To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift.",human
"Synthetic tabular data, which are widely used in domains such as healthcare, enterprise operations, and customer analytics, are increasingly evaluated to ensure that they preserve both privacy and utility. While existing evaluation practices typically focus on distributional similarity (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence) or predictive performance (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) accuracy), these approaches fail to assess semantic fidelity, that is, whether models trained on synthetic data follow reasoning patterns consistent with those trained on real data. To address this gap, we introduce the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Distance, a novel explainability-aware metric that is defined as the cosine distance between the global SHAP attribution vectors derived from classifiers trained on real versus synthetic datasets. By analyzing datasets that span clinical health records with physiological features, enterprise invoice transactions with heterogeneous scales, and telecom churn logs with mixed categorical-numerical attributes, we demonstrate that the SHAP Distance reliably identifies semantic discrepancies that are overlooked by standard statistical and predictive measures. In particular, our results show that the SHAP Distance captures feature importance shifts and underrepresented tail effects that the Kullback-Leibler divergence and Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real accuracy fail to detect. This study positions the SHAP Distance as a practical and discriminative tool for auditing the semantic fidelity of synthetic tabular data, and offers practical guidelines for integrating attribution-based evaluation into future benchmarking pipelines.",human
"Cross-platform strategy game automation remains a challenge due to diverse user interfaces and dynamic battlefield environments. Existing Vision--Language Models (VLMs) struggle with generalization across heterogeneous platforms and lack precision in interface understanding and action execution. We introduce Yanyun-3, a VLM-based agent that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for visual reasoning and UI-TARS for interface execution. We propose a novel data organization principle -- combination granularity -- to distinguish intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing of multimodal data (static images, multi-image sequences, and videos). The model is fine-tuned using QLoRA on a curated dataset across three strategy game platforms. The optimal strategy (M*V+S) achieves a 12.98x improvement in BLEU-4 score and a 63% reduction in inference time compared to full fusion. Yanyun-3 successfully executes core tasks (e.g., target selection, resource allocation) across platforms without platform-specific tuning. Our findings demonstrate that structured multimodal data organization significantly enhances VLM performance in embodied tasks. Yanyun-3 offers a generalizable framework for GUI automation, with broader implications for robotics and autonomous systems.",human
"In federated learning, multiple parties can cooperate to train the model without directly exchanging their own private data, but the gradient leakage problem still threatens the privacy security and model integrity. Although the existing scheme uses threshold cryptography to mitigate the inference attack, it can not guarantee the verifiability of the aggregation results, making the system vulnerable to the threat of poisoning attack. We construct a partial decryption verifiable threshold multi client function encryption scheme, and apply it to Federated learning to implement the federated learning verifiable threshold security aggregation protocol (VTSAFL). VTSAFL empowers clients to verify aggregation results, concurrently minimizing both computational and communication overhead. The size of the functional key and partial decryption results of the scheme are constant, which provides efficiency guarantee for large-scale deployment. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that vtsafl can achieve the same accuracy as the existing scheme, while reducing the total training time by more than 40%, and reducing the communication overhead by up to 50%. This efficiency is critical for overcoming the resource constraints inherent in Internet of Things (IoT) devices.",human
"We propose PFAvatar (Pose-Fusion Avatar), a new method that reconstructs high-quality 3D avatars from Outfit of the Day(OOTD) photos, which exhibit diverse poses, occlusions, and complex backgrounds. Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48x speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach.",human
"In industrial recommendation systems, pre-ranking models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) commonly adopt a sequential execution framework: feature fetching and model forward computation are triggered only after receiving candidates from the upstream retrieval stage. This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs. This has enabled the successful deployment of AIF in the Taobao display advertising system.",human
"Can multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) truly understand what they can see? Extending Searle's Chinese Room into the multi-modal domain, this paper proposes the Visual Room argument: MLLMs may describe every visual detail precisely yet fail to comprehend the underlying emotions and intentions, namely seeing is not understanding. Building on this, we introduce \textit{Visual Room} 2.0, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating perception-cognition alignment of MLLMs. We model human perceptive and cognitive processes across three levels: low, middle, and high, covering 17 representative tasks. The perception component ranges from attribute recognition to scene understanding, while the cognition component extends from textual entailment to causal and social reasoning. The dataset contains 350 multi-modal samples, each with six progressive questions (2,100 in total) spanning perception to cognition. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs, we highlight three key findings: (1) MLLMs exhibit stronger perceptual competence than cognitive ability (8.0\%$\uparrow$); (2) cognition appears not causally dependent on perception-based reasoning; and (3) cognition scales with model size, but perception does not consistently improve with larger variants. This work operationalizes Seeing $\ne$ Understanding as a testable hypothesis, offering a new paradigm from perceptual processing to cognitive reasoning in MLLMs. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LHK2003/PCBench.",human
"Large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems have achieved high-quality performance by bridging the discrepancy between the item space and the language space through item tokenization. However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines.",human
"Google Search increasingly surfaces AI-generated content through features like AI Overviews (AIO) and Featured Snippets (FS), which users frequently rely on despite having no control over their presentation. Through a systematic algorithm audit of 1,508 real baby care and pregnancy-related queries, we evaluate the quality and consistency of these information displays. Our robust evaluation framework assesses multiple quality dimensions, including answer consistency, relevance, presence of medical safeguards, source categories, and sentiment alignment. Our results reveal concerning gaps in information consistency, with information in AIO and FS displayed on the same search result page being inconsistent with each other in 33% of cases. Despite high relevance scores, both features critically lack medical safeguards (present in just 11% of AIO and 7% of FS responses). While health and wellness websites dominate source categories for both, AIO and FS, FS also often link to commercial sources. These findings have important implications for public health information access and demonstrate the need for stronger quality controls in AI-mediated health information. Our methodology provides a transferable framework for auditing AI systems across high-stakes domains where information quality directly impacts user well-being.",human
"Power grid fault diagnosis is a critical process hindered by its reliance on manual, error-prone methods. Technicians must manually extract reasoning logic from dense regulations and attempt to combine it with tacit expert knowledge, which is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks maintainability as ragulations are updated and experience evolves. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in parsing unstructured text, no existing framework integrates these two disparate knowledge sources into a single, verified, and executable workflow. To bridge this gap, we propose Fault2Flow, an LLM-based multi-agent system. Fault2Flow systematically: (1) extracts and structures regulatory logic into PASTA-formatted fault trees; (2) integrates expert knowledge via a human-in-the-loop interface for verification; (3) optimizes the reasoning logic using a novel AlphaEvolve module; and (4) synthesizes the final, verified logic into an n8n-executable workflow. Experimental validation on transformer fault diagnosis datasets confirms 100\% topological consistency and high semantic fidelity. Fault2Flow establishes a reproducible path from fault analysis to operational automation, substantially reducing expert workload.",human
"Recommending event schedules is a key issue in Event-based Social Networks (EBSNs) in order to maintain user activity. An effective recommendation is required to maximize the user's preference, subjecting to both time and geographical constraints. Existing methods face an inherent trade-off among efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization, due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. This paper proposes the Chain-of-Scheduling (CoS) framework, which activates the event scheduling capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a guided, efficient scheduling process. CoS enhances LLM by formulating the schedule task into three atomic stages, i.e., exploration, verification and integration. Then we enable the LLMs to generate CoS autonomously via Knowledge Distillation (KD). Experimental results show that CoS achieves near-theoretical optimal effectiveness with high efficiency on three real-world datasets in a interpretable manner. Moreover, it demonstrates strong zero-shot learning ability on out-of-domain data.",human
"Sports video understanding presents unique challenges, requiring models to perceive high-speed dynamics, comprehend complex rules, and reason over long temporal contexts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in genral domains, the current state of research in sports remains narrowly focused: existing approaches are either single-sport centric, limited to specific tasks, or rely on training-free paradigms that lack robust, learned reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce DeepSport, the first end-to-end trained MLLM framework designed for multi-task, multi-sport video understanding. DeepSport shifts the paradigm from passive frame processing to active, iterative reasoning, empowering the model to ``think with videos'' by dynamically interrogating content via a specialized frame-extraction tool. To enable this, we propose a data distillation pipeline that synthesizes high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories from 10 diverse data source, creating a unified resource of 78k training data. We then employ a two-stage training strategy, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel gated tool-use reward, to optimize the model's reasoning process. Extensive experiments on the testing benchmark of 6.7k questions demonstrate that DeepSport achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines of both proprietary model and open-source models. Our work establishes a new foundation for domain-specific video reasoning to address the complexities of diverse sports.",human
"Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.",human
"This study explores the relationship between LinkedIn profile characteristics and professional success, focusing on the indicators of promotions, follower count, and career progression rate. By leveraging a dataset of over 62,000 anonymized LinkedIn profiles, we developed predictive models using machine learning techniques to identify the most influential factors driving professional success. Results indicate that while promotions are highly predictable, follower growth exhibits greater complexity. This research provides actionable insights for professionals seeking to optimize their LinkedIn presence and career strategies.",human
"This paper studies the interpretability of neural network features from a Bayesian Gaussian view, where optimizing a cost is reaching a probabilistic bound; learning a model approximates a density that makes the bound tight and the cost optimal, often with a Gaussian mixture density. The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.   We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.   Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively.",human
"We present online learning of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) methods in the context of integrated HTN planning and LLM-based chatbots. Methods indicate when and how to decompose tasks into subtasks. Our method learner is built on top of the ChatHTN planner. ChatHTN queries ChatGPT to generate a decomposition of a task into primitive tasks when no applicable method for the task is available. In this work, we extend ChatHTN. Namely, when ChatGPT generates a task decomposition, ChatHTN learns from it, akin to memoization. However, unlike memoization, it learns a generalized method that applies not only to the specific instance encountered, but to other instances of the same task. We conduct experiments on two domains and demonstrate that our online learning procedure reduces the number of calls to ChatGPT while solving at least as many problems, and in some cases, even more.",human
"We present Functional Mean Flow (FMF) as a one-step generative model defined in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. FMF extends the one-step Mean Flow framework to functional domains by providing a theoretical formulation for Functional Flow Matching and a practical implementation for efficient training and sampling. We also introduce an $x_1$-prediction variant that improves stability over the original $u$-prediction form. The resulting framework is a practical one-step Flow Matching method applicable to a wide range of functional data generation tasks such as time series, images, PDEs, and 3D geometry.",human
"Training neural operators to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces often requires extensive datasets generated by either demanding experimental setups or computationally expensive numerical solvers. This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training.",human
"Embodied world models aim to predict and interact with the physical world through visual observations and actions. However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios.",human
"Leveraging the Wasserstein distance -- a summation of sample-wise transport distances in data space -- is advantageous in many applications for measuring support differences between two underlying density functions. However, when supports significantly overlap while densities exhibit substantial pointwise differences, it remains unclear whether and how this transport information can accurately identify these differences, particularly their analytic characterization in finite-sample settings. We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences. The analyzed properties are confirmed using neural spike train decoding and amino acid contact frequency data. The results reveal that the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance highlights meaningful density differences related to both rate and support.",human
"Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.",human
"This paper presents a transformer-based approach for classifying hope expressions in text. We developed and compared three architectures (BERT, GPT-2, and DeBERTa) for both binary classification (Hope vs. Not Hope) and multiclass categorization (five hope-related categories). Our initial BERT implementation achieved 83.65% binary and 74.87% multiclass accuracy. In the extended comparison, BERT demonstrated superior performance (84.49% binary, 72.03% multiclass accuracy) while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (443s vs. 704s training time) than newer architectures. GPT-2 showed lowest overall accuracy (79.34% binary, 71.29% multiclass), while DeBERTa achieved moderate results (80.70% binary, 71.56% multiclass) but at substantially higher computational cost (947s for multiclass training). Error analysis revealed architecture-specific strengths in detecting nuanced hope expressions, with GPT-2 excelling at sarcasm detection (92.46% recall). This study provides a framework for computational analysis of hope, with applications in mental health and social media analysis, while demonstrating that architectural suitability may outweigh model size for specialized emotion detection tasks.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.",human
"Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in visual understanding, yet their extension from images to videos often reduces to a naive concatenation of frame tokens. In this work, we investigate what video finetuning brings to multimodal LLMs. We propose Visual Chain-of-Thought (vCoT), an explicit reasoning process that generates transitional event descriptions between consecutive frames. Using vCoT, we systematically compare image-only LVLMs with their video-finetuned counterparts, both with and without access to these transitional cues. Our experiments show that vCoT significantly improves the performance of image-only models on long-form video question answering, while yielding only marginal gains for video-finetuned models. This suggests that the latter already capture frame-to-frame transitions implicitly. Moreover, we find that video models transfer this temporal reasoning ability to purely static settings, outperforming image models' baselines on relational visual reasoning tasks.",human
"Bootstrapping large language models (LLMs) through preference-based policy optimization offers a promising direction for aligning model behavior with human preferences without relying on extensive manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques.",human
"Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.   This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.   Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.",human
"This paper investigates a project with stochastic activity durations and cash flows under discrete scenarios, where activities must satisfy precedence constraints generating cash inflows and outflows. The objective is to maximize expected net present value (NPV) by accelerating inflows and deferring outflows. We formulate the problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) approach. Comparative experiments demonstrate that DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies, particularly in large-scale or highly uncertain environments, exhibiting superior computational capability, policy reliability, and adaptability. Ablation studies further reveal that the dual-network architecture mitigates overestimation of action values, while the target network substantially improves training convergence and robustness. These results indicate that DDQN not only achieves higher expected NPV in complex project optimization but also provides a reliable framework for stable and effective policy implementation.",human
"With the remarkable success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in perception tasks, enhancing their complex reasoning capabilities has emerged as a critical research focus. Existing models still suffer from challenges such as opaque reasoning paths and insufficient generalization ability. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which has demonstrated significant efficacy in language models by enhancing reasoning transparency and output interpretability, holds promise for improving model reasoning capabilities when extended to the multimodal domain. This paper provides a systematic review centered on ""Multimodal Chain-of-Thought"" (MCoT). First, it analyzes the background and theoretical motivations for its inception from the perspectives of technical evolution and task demands. Then, it introduces mainstream MCoT methods from three aspects: CoT paradigms, the post-training stage, and the inference stage, while also analyzing their underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper summarizes existing evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and discusses the application scenarios of MCoT. Finally, it analyzes the challenges currently facing MCoT and provides an outlook on its future research directions.",human
"Deep neural networks achieve state of the art performance but remain difficult to interpret mechanistically. In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability.",human
"Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) reports encode domain-specific linguistic conventions that general-purpose language models (LMs) fail to capture. We introduce NeuroLex, a lightweight domain-adaptive language model trained purely on EEG report text from the Harvard Electroencephalography Database. Unlike existing biomedical LMs, NeuroLex is tailored to the linguistic and diagnostic characteristics of EEG reporting, enabling it to serve as both an independent textual model and a decoder backbone for multimodal EEG-language systems. Using span-corruption pretraining and instruction-style fine-tuning on report polishing, paragraph summarization, and terminology question answering, NeuroLex learns the syntax and reasoning patterns characteristic of EEG interpretation. Comprehensive evaluations show that it achieves lower perplexity, higher extraction and summarization accuracy, better label efficiency, and improved robustness to negation and factual hallucination compared with general models of the same scale. With an EEG-aware linguistic backbone, NeuroLex bridges biomedical text modeling and brain-computer interface applications, offering a foundation for interpretable and language-driven neural decoding.",human
"Topic modelling in Natural Language Processing uncovers hidden topics in large, unlabelled text datasets. It is widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, content summarisation, and trend analysis across various disciplines. However, probabilistic topic models can produce different results when rerun due to their stochastic nature, leading to inconsistencies in latent topics. Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth. These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents. We also find that LDA is more internally consistent, as the multiple reruns return similar topics; however, these topics are not the true topics.",human
"Generative model-based imitation learning methods have recently achieved strong results in learning high-complexity motor skills from human demonstrations. However, imitation learning of interactive policies that coordinate with humans in shared spaces without explicit communication remains challenging, due to the significantly higher behavioral complexity in multi-agent interactions compared to non-interactive tasks. In this work, we introduce a structured imitation learning framework for interactive policies by combining generative single-agent policy learning with a flexible yet expressive game-theoretic structure. Our method explicitly separates learning into two steps: first, we learn individual behavioral patterns from multi-agent demonstrations using standard imitation learning; then, we structurally learn inter-agent dependencies by solving an inverse game problem. Preliminary results in a synthetic 5-agent social navigation task show that our method significantly improves non-interactive policies and performs comparably to the ground truth interactive policy using only 50 demonstrations. These results highlight the potential of structured imitation learning in interactive settings.",human
"Online change detection (OCD) aims to rapidly identify change points in streaming data and is critical in applications such as power system monitoring, wireless network sensing, and financial anomaly detection. Existing OCD methods typically assume precise system knowledge, which is unrealistic due to estimation errors and environmental variations. Moreover, existing OCD methods often struggle with efficiency in large-scale systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose RoS-Guard, a robust and optimal OCD algorithm tailored for linear systems with uncertainty. Through a tight relaxation and reformulation of the OCD optimization problem, RoS-Guard employs neural unrolling to enable efficient parallel computation via GPU acceleration. The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees on performance, including expected false alarm rate and worst-case average detection delay. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoS-Guard and demonstrate significant computational speedup in large-scale system scenarios.",human
"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology that aligns agent behavior with human preferences by integrating human feedback into the agent's training process. We introduce a possible framework that employs passive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to guide agent training from implicit neural signals. We present and release a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: a Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems.",human
"Macroscopic dynamical descriptions of complex physical systems are crucial for understanding and controlling material behavior. With the growing availability of data and compute, machine learning has become a promising alternative to first-principles methods to build accurate macroscopic models from microscopic trajectory simulations. However, for spatially extended systems, direct simulations of sufficiently large microscopic systems that inform macroscopic behavior is prohibitive. In this work, we propose a framework that learns the macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic microscopic systems using only small-system simulations. Our framework employs a partial evolution scheme to generate training data pairs by evolving large-system snapshots within local patches. We subsequently identify the closure variables associated with the macroscopic observables and learn the macroscopic dynamics using a custom loss. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical upsampling scheme that enables efficient generation of large-system snapshots from small-system trajectory distributions. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our framework through a variety of stochastic spatially extended systems, including those described by stochastic partial differential equations, idealised lattice spin systems, and a more realistic NbMoTa alloy system.",human
"Modern machine learning models with a large number of parameters often generalize well despite perfectly interpolating noisy training data - a phenomenon known as benign overfitting. A foundational explanation for this in linear classification was recently provided by Hashimoto et al. (2025). However, this analysis was limited to the setting of ""homogeneous"" models, which lack a bias (intercept) term - a standard component in practice. This work directly extends Hashimoto et al.'s results to the more realistic inhomogeneous case, which incorporates a bias term. Our analysis proves that benign overfitting persists in these more complex models. We find that the presence of the bias term introduces new constraints on the data's covariance structure required for generalization, an effect that is particularly pronounced when label noise is present. However, we show that in the isotropic case, these new constraints are dominated by the requirements inherited from the homogeneous model. This work provides a more complete picture of benign overfitting, revealing the non-trivial impact of the bias term on the conditions required for good generalization.",human
"Higher-order Graph Neural Networks (HOGNNs) based on the 2-FWL test achieve superior expressivity by modeling 2- and 3-node interactions, but at $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ computational cost. However, this computational burden is typically mitigated by existing efficiency methods at the cost of reduced expressivity. We propose \textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling. We prove that Co-Sparsified GNNs are as expressive as the 2-FWL test. Empirically, on PPGN, Co-Sparsify matches or exceeds accuracy on synthetic substructure counting tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks (ZINC, QM9). This study demonstrates that high expressivity and scalability are not mutually exclusive: principled, topology-guided sparsification enables powerful, efficient GNNs with theoretical guarantees.",human
"Sampling from a target distribution induced by training data is central to Bayesian learning, with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) serving as a key tool for scalable posterior sampling and decentralized variants enabling learning when data are distributed across a network of agents. This paper introduces DIGing-SGLD, a decentralized SGLD algorithm designed for scalable Bayesian learning in multi-agent systems operating over time-varying networks. Existing decentralized SGLD methods are restricted to static network topologies, and many exhibit steady-state sampling bias caused by network effects, even when full batches are used. DIGing-SGLD overcomes these limitations by integrating Langevin-based sampling with the gradient-tracking mechanism of the DIGing algorithm, originally developed for decentralized optimization over time-varying networks, thereby enabling efficient and bias-free sampling without a central coordinator. To our knowledge, we provide the first finite-time non-asymptotic Wasserstein convergence guarantees for decentralized SGLD-based sampling over time-varying networks, with explicit constants. Under standard strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, DIGing-SGLD achieves geometric convergence to an $O(\sqrtη)$ neighborhood of the target distribution, where $η$ is the stepsize, with dependence on the target accuracy matching the best-known rates for centralized and static-network SGLD algorithms using constant stepsize. Numerical experiments on Bayesian linear and logistic regression validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the strong empirical performance of DIGing-SGLD under dynamically evolving network conditions.",human
"The proliferation of generative AI has led to hyper-realistic synthetic videos, escalating misuse risks and outstripping binary real/fake detectors. We introduce SAGA (Source Attribution of Generative AI videos), the first comprehensive framework to address the urgent need for AI-generated video source attribution at a large scale. Unlike traditional detection, SAGA identifies the specific generative model used. It uniquely provides multi-granular attribution across five levels: authenticity, generation task (e.g., T2V/I2V), model version, development team, and the precise generator, offering far richer forensic insights. Our novel video transformer architecture, leveraging features from a robust vision foundation model, effectively captures spatio-temporal artifacts. Critically, we introduce a data-efficient pretrain-and-attribute strategy, enabling SAGA to achieve state-of-the-art attribution using only 0.5\% of source-labeled data per class, matching fully supervised performance. Furthermore, we propose Temporal Attention Signatures (T-Sigs), a novel interpretability method that visualizes learned temporal differences, offering the first explanation for why different video generators are distinguishable. Extensive experiments on public datasets, including cross-domain scenarios, demonstrate that SAGA sets a new benchmark for synthetic video provenance, providing crucial, interpretable insights for forensic and regulatory applications.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing conversational fluency, yet instilling them with nuanced, human-like emotional expression remains a significant challenge. Current alignment techniques often address surface-level output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement. Our findings offer a precise and interpretable framework and new directions for the study of conversational AI.",human
"We present a systematic evaluation of representation learning objectives for particle physics within a unified framework. Our study employs a shared transformer-based particle-cloud encoder with standardized preprocessing, matched sampling, and a consistent evaluation protocol on a jet classification dataset. We compare contrastive (supervised and self-supervised), masked particle modeling, and generative reconstruction objectives under a common training regimen. In addition, we introduce targeted supervised architectural modifications that achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark evaluations. This controlled comparison isolates the contributions of the learning objective, highlights their respective strengths and limitations, and provides reproducible baselines. We position this work as a reference point for the future development of foundation models in particle physics, enabling more transparent and robust progress across the community.",human
"Catastrophic forgetting is a longstanding challenge in continual learning, where models lose knowledge from earlier tasks when learning new ones. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), recent architectural advances like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been suggested to offer intrinsic resistance to forgetting by leveraging localized spline-based activations. However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks. Our findings reveal that while KANs exhibit promising retention in low-dimensional algorithmic settings, they remain vulnerable to forgetting in high-dimensional domains such as image classification and language modeling. These results advance the understanding of KANs' strengths and limitations, offering practical insights for continual learning system design.",human
"The deployment of robust malware detection systems in big data environments requires careful consideration of both security effectiveness and computational efficiency. While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Override (TRO) with Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction (CABDR) to explicitly optimize the trade-off between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages adaptive confidence-based mechanisms to selectively apply defensive measures, achieving 1.76x computational overhead - a 2.3x improvement over state-of-the-art smoothing defenses. Through comprehensive evaluation on the EMBER v2 dataset comprising 800K samples, we demonstrate that our framework maintains 91 percent clean accuracy while reducing attack success rates to 31-37 percent across multiple attack types, with particularly strong performance against optimization-based attacks such as C and W (48.8 percent reduction). The framework achieves throughput of up to 1.26 million samples per second (measured on pre-extracted EMBER features with no runtime feature extraction), validated across 72 production configurations with statistical significance (5 independent runs, 95 percent confidence intervals, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that practical adversarial robustness in production environments requires explicit optimization of the efficiency-robustness trade-off, providing a viable path for organizations to deploy robust defenses without prohibitive infrastructure costs.",human
"Over the past few years, improving LLM code generation capabilities has been a key focus in NLP research. Despite Bengali having 242 million native speakers worldwide, it receives little attention when it comes to training LLMs. More recently, various fine-tuning and augmented generation techniques have been employed to significantly enhance code generation performance. However, they require considerable expertise and resources to utilize effectively as an end user. The goal of our work is to democratize access to powerful code generation tools in resource-constrained emerging markets, enabling users to leverage them in their native language.   We introduce a novel approach that combines Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Code Interpreter (CI), utilizing open-weight models, which improves the baseline accuracy for code generation with Bengali prompts and achieves an overall accuracy of 85%. Our approach requires no finetuning and proves that even the smallest models in the same family can attain up to 98% accuracy compared to the largest models. All of our results are publicly shared in GitHub for validation and reproducibility.",human
"Assessing journal impact is central to scholarly communication, yet existing open resources rarely capture how collaboration structures and artificial intelligence (AI) research jointly shape venue prestige in biomedicine. We present BioMedJImpact, a large-scale, biomedical-oriented dataset designed to advance journal-level analysis of scientific impact and AI engagement. Built from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, BioMedJImpact integrates bibliometric indicators, collaboration features, and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. Specifically, the AI engagement feature is extracted through a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline that we propose. Using this dataset, we analyze how collaboration intensity and AI engagement jointly influence scientific impact across pre- and post-pandemic periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). Two consistent trends emerge: journals with higher collaboration intensity, particularly those with larger and more diverse author teams, tend to achieve greater citation impact, and AI engagement has become an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige, especially in quartile rankings. To further validate the three-stage LLM pipeline we proposed for deriving the AI engagement feature, we conduct human evaluation, confirming substantial agreement in AI relevance detection and consistent subfield classification. Together, these contributions demonstrate that BioMedJImpact serves as both a comprehensive dataset capturing the intersection of biomedicine and AI, and a validated methodological framework enabling scalable, content-aware scientometric analysis of scientific impact and innovation dynamics.

"The recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs) holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare, with strong capabilities in diverse medical tasks. Yet, deploying LLMs in high-stakes healthcare settings requires rigorous verification and validation to understand any potential harm. This paper investigates the reliability and viability of using medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for the automated factuality evaluation of LLM-generated responses. To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare.",human
"Camouflaged object detection is an emerging and challenging computer vision task that requires identifying and segmenting objects that blend seamlessly into their environments due to high similarity in color, texture, and size. This task is further complicated by low-light conditions, partial occlusion, small object size, intricate background patterns, and multiple objects. While many sophisticated methods have been proposed for this task, current methods still struggle to precisely detect camouflaged objects in complex scenarios, especially with small and multiple objects, indicating room for improvement. We propose a Multi-Scale Recursive Network that extracts multi-scale features via a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone and combines them via specialized Attention-Based Scale Integration Units, enabling selective feature merging. For more precise object detection, our decoder recursively refines features by incorporating Multi-Granularity Fusion Units. A novel recursive-feedback decoding strategy is developed to enhance global context understanding, helping the model overcome the challenges in this task. By jointly leveraging multi-scale learning and recursive feature optimization, our proposed method achieves performance gains, successfully detecting small and multiple camouflaged objects. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets for camouflaged object detection and ranks second on the remaining two. Our codes, model weights, and results are available at \href{https://github.com/linaagh98/MSRNet}{https://github.com/linaagh98/MSRNet}.",human
"Specifying informative and dense reward functions remains a pivotal challenge in Reinforcement Learning, as it directly affects the efficiency of agent training. In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.",human
"Estimating causal networks from biological data is a critical step in systems biology. When evaluating the inferred network, assessing the networks based on their intervention effects is particularly important for downstream probabilistic reasoning and the identification of potential drug targets. In the context of gene regulatory network inference, biological databases are often used as reference sources. These databases typically describe relationships in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. However, few evaluation metrics have been developed that take this qualitative nature into account. To address this, we developed a metric, the sign-augmented Structural Intervention Distance (sSID), and a weighted sSID that incorporates the net effects of the intervention. Through simulations and analyses of real transcriptomic datasets, we found that our proposed metrics could identify a different algorithm as optimal compared to conventional metrics, and the network selected by sSID had a superior performance in the classification task of clinical covariates using transcriptomic data. This suggests that sSID can distinguish networks that are structurally correct but functionally incorrect, highlighting its potential as a more biologically meaningful and practical evaluation metric.",human
"In self-consuming generative models that train on their own outputs, alignment with user preferences becomes a recursive rather than one-time process. We provide the first formal foundation for analyzing the long-term effects of such recursive retraining on alignment. Under a two-stage curation mechanism based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, we model alignment as an interaction between two factions: the Model Owner, who filters which outputs should be learned by the model, and the Public User, who determines which outputs are ultimately shared and retained through interactions with the model. Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence.",human
"In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?   To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.",human
"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on preference modeling to align machine learning systems with human values, yet the popular approach of random pair sampling with Bradley-Terry modeling is statistically limited and inefficient under constrained annotation budgets. In this work, we explore alternative sampling and evaluation strategies for preference inference in RLHF, drawing inspiration from areas such as game theory, statistics, and social choice theory. Our best-performing method, Swiss InfoGain, employs a Swiss tournament system with a proxy mutual-information-gain pairing rule, which significantly outperforms all other methods in constrained annotation budgets while also being more sample-efficient. Even in high-resource settings, we can identify superior alternatives to the Bradley-Terry baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive, resource-aware strategies reduce redundancy, enhance robustness, and yield statistically significant improvements in preference learning, highlighting the importance of balancing alignment quality with human workload in RLHF pipelines.",human
"Solving Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) problems with neural networks is a key challenge in Neural-Symbolic Ar- tificial Intelligence (AI). While most research has focused on designing novel network architectures for individual prob- lems, less effort has been devoted to exploring new learning paradigms involving a sequence of problems. In this work, we investigate lifelong learning ILP, which leverages the com- positional and transferable nature of logic rules for efficient learning of new problems. We introduce a compositional framework, demonstrating how logic rules acquired from ear- lier tasks can be efficiently reused in subsequent ones, leading to improved scalability and performance. We formalize our approach and empirically evaluate it on sequences of tasks. Experimental results validate the feasibility and advantages of this paradigm, opening new directions for continual learn- ing in Neural-Symbolic AI.",human
"This work investigates resource optimization in heterogeneous satellite clusters performing autonomous Earth Observation (EO) missions using Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the proposed setting, two optical satellites and one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite operate cooperatively in low Earth orbit to capture ground targets and manage their limited onboard resources efficiently. Traditional optimization methods struggle to handle the real-time, uncertain, and decentralized nature of EO operations, motivating the use of RL and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive decision-making. This study systematically formulates the optimization problem from single-satellite to multi-satellite scenarios, addressing key challenges including energy and memory constraints, partial observability, and agent heterogeneity arising from diverse payload capabilities. Using a near-realistic simulation environment built on the Basilisk and BSK-RL frameworks, we evaluate the performance and stability of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO, HAPPO, and HATRPO. Results show that MARL enables effective coordination across heterogeneous satellites, balancing imaging performance and resource utilization while mitigating non-stationarity and inter-agent reward coupling. The findings provide practical insights into scalable, autonomous satellite operations and contribute a foundation for future research on intelligent EO mission planning under heterogeneous and dynamic conditions.",human
"Selecting an appropriate look-back horizon remains a fundamental challenge in time series forecasting (TSF), particularly in the federated learning scenarios where data is decentralized, heterogeneous, and often non-independent. While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning.",human
"The semiconductor industry faces a computational crisis in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography optimization, where traditional methods consume billions of CPU hours while failing to achieve sub-nanometer precision. We present a physics-constrained adaptive learning framework that automatically calibrates electromagnetic approximations through learnable parameters $\boldsymbolθ = \{θ_d, θ_a, θ_b, θ_p, θ_c\}$ while simultaneously minimizing Edge Placement Error (EPE) between simulated aerial images and target photomasks. The framework integrates differentiable modules for Fresnel diffraction, material absorption, optical point spread function blur, phase-shift effects, and contrast modulation with direct geometric pattern matching objectives, enabling cross-geometry generalization with minimal training data. Through physics-constrained learning on 15 representative patterns spanning current production to future research nodes, we demonstrate consistent sub-nanometer EPE performance (0.664-2.536 nm range) using only 50 training samples per pattern. Adaptive physics learning achieves an average improvement of 69.9\% over CNN baselines without physics constraints, with a significant inference speedup over rigorous electromagnetic solvers after training completion. This approach requires 90\% fewer training samples through cross-geometry generalization compared to pattern-specific CNN training approaches. This work establishes physics-constrained adaptive learning as a foundational methodology for real-time semiconductor manufacturing optimization, addressing the critical gap between academic physics-informed neural networks and industrial deployment requirements through joint physics calibration and manufacturing precision objectives.",human
"Color harmonization adjusts the colors of an inserted object so that it perceptually matches the surrounding image, resulting in a seamless composite. The harmonization problem naturally arises in augmented reality (AR), yet harmonization algorithms are not currently integrated into AR pipelines because real-time solutions are scarce. In this work, we address color harmonization for AR by proposing a lightweight approach that supports on-device inference. For this, we leverage classical optimal transport theory by training a compact encoder to predict the Monge-Kantorovich transport map. We benchmark our MKL-Harmonizer algorithm against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that for real composite AR images our method achieves the best aggregated score. We release our dedicated AR dataset of composite images with pixel-accurate masks and data-gathering toolkit to support further data acquisition by researchers.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for autoformalization. Despite their impressive performance, these models can still struggle to produce grounded and verifiable formalizations. Recent work in text-to-SQL, has revealed that LLMs can be sensitive to paraphrased natural language (NL) inputs, even when high degrees of semantic fidelity are preserved (Safarzadeh, Oroojlooyjadid, and Roth 2025). In this paper, we investigate this claim in the autoformalization domain. Specifically, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs generating formal proofs with semantically similar paraphrased NL statements by measuring semantic and compilation validity. Using the formal benchmarks MiniF2F (Zheng, Han, and Polu 2021) and Lean 4 version of ProofNet (Xin et al. 2024), and two modern LLMs, we generate paraphrased natural language statements and cross-evaluate these statements across both models. The results of this paper reveal performance variability across paraphrased inputs, demonstrating that minor shifts in NL statements can significantly impact model outputs.",human
"Bayesian optimization (BO) has been widely used to optimize expensive and gradient-free objective functions across various domains. However, existing BO methods have not addressed the objective where both inputs and outputs are functions, which increasingly arise in complex systems as advanced sensing technologies. To fill this gap, we propose a novel function-on-function Bayesian optimization (FFBO) framework. Specifically, we first introduce a function-on-function Gaussian process (FFGP) model with a separable operator-valued kernel to capture the correlations between function-valued inputs and outputs. Compared to existing Gaussian process models, FFGP is modeled directly in the function space. Based on FFGP, we define a scalar upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function using a weighted operator-based scalarization strategy. Then, a scalable functional gradient ascent algorithm (FGA) is developed to efficiently identify the optimal function-valued input. We further analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of FFBO over existing approaches.",human
Current Large Language Model alignment research mostly focuses on improving model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on examples and prompting. Research has shown that LLM jailbreak probability increases with the size of the user input or conversation length. There is a lack of appropriate research into means of strengthening alignment which also scale with user input length. We propose interruptions as a possible solution to this problem. Interruptions are control sentences added to the user input approximately every x tokens for some arbitrary x. We suggest that this can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming.,human
"Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.",human
"We study the problem of efficiently estimating policies that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). Given $n$ objectives (or tasks), we seek the optimal partition of these objectives into $k \ll n$ groups, where each group comprises related objectives that can be trained together. This problem arises in applications such as robotics, control, and preference optimization in language models, where learning a single policy for all $n$ objectives is suboptimal as $n$ grows. We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a $2\%$ error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm. Based on the estimated affinity score matrix, we cluster the $n$ objectives into $k$ groups by maximizing the intra-cluster affinity scores. Experiments on three robotic control and the Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $16\%$ on average, while delivering up to $26\times$ faster speedup relative to performing full training to obtain the clusters. Ablation studies validate each component of our approach. For instance, compared with random grouping and gradient-similarity-based grouping, our loss-based clustering yields an improvement of $19\%$. Finally, we analyze the generalization error of policy networks by measuring the Hessian trace of the loss surface, which gives non-vacuous measures relative to the observed generalization errors.",human
"Avoiding bias and understanding the real-world consequences of AI-supported decision-making are critical to address fairness and assign accountability. Existing approaches often focus either on technical aspects, such as datasets and models, or on high-level socio-ethical considerations - rarely capturing how these elements interact in practice. In this paper, we apply an information flow-based modeling framework to a real-world recruitment process that integrates automated candidate matching with human decision-making. Through semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling, we construct a multi-level representation of the recruitment pipeline, capturing how information is transformed, filtered, and interpreted across both algorithmic and human components. We identify where biases may emerge, how they can propagate through the system, and what downstream impacts they may have on candidates. This case study illustrates how information flow modeling can support structured analysis of fairness risks, providing transparency across complex socio-technical systems.",human
"Understanding and continuously refining multimodal molecular knowledge is crucial for advancing biomedicine, chemistry, and materials science. Molecule language models (MoLMs) have become powerful tools in these domains, integrating structural representations (e.g., SMILES strings, molecular graphs) with rich contextual descriptions (e.g., physicochemical properties). However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries). Across extensive experiments on two popular MoLM backbones, MolEdit delivers up to 18.8% higher Reliability and 12.0% better Locality than baselines while maintaining efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/LzyFischer/MolEdit.",human
"While spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling recurring traffic patterns, their reliability plummets during non-recurring events like accidents. This failure occurs because GNNs are fundamentally correlational models, learning historical patterns that are invalidated by the new causal factors introduced during disruptions. To address this, we propose Event-CausNet, a framework that uses a Large Language Model to quantify unstructured event reports, builds a causal knowledge base by estimating average treatment effects, and injects this knowledge into a dual-stream GNN-LSTM network using a novel causal attention mechanism to adjust and enhance the forecast. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework bridges the gap between correlational models and causal reasoning, providing a solution that is more accurate and transferable, while also offering crucial interpretability, providing a more reliable foundation for real-world traffic management during critical disruptions.",human
"Phase transitions have been proposed as the origin of emergent abilities in large language models (LLMs), where new capabilities appear abruptly once models surpass critical thresholds of scale. Prior work, such as that of Wei et al., demonstrated these phenomena under model and data scaling, with transitions revealed after applying a log scale to training compute. In this work, we ask three complementary questions: (1) Are phase transitions unique to large models, or can they also be observed in small transformer-based language models? (2) Can such transitions be detected directly in linear training space, rather than only after log rescaling? and (3) Can these transitions emerge at early stages of training? To investigate, we train a small GPT-style transformer on a character-level corpus and analyze the evolution of vocabulary usage throughout training. We track the average word length, the number of correct versus incorrect words, and shifts in vocabulary diversity. Building on these measures, we apply Poisson and sub-Poisson statistics to quantify how words connect and reorganize. This combined analysis reveals a distinct transition point during training. Notably, these transitions are not apparent in standard loss or validation curves, but become visible through our vocabulary- and statistics-based probes. Our findings suggest that phase-transition reorganizations are a general feature of language model training, observable even in modest models, detectable directly in linear training space, and occurring surprisingly early as coherence emerges. This perspective provides new insight into the nonlinear dynamics of language model training and underscores the importance of tailored metrics for uncovering phase transition behaviors",human
"Automatic sign language recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between deaf communities and hearing individuals; however, most available datasets focus on American Sign Language. For Romanian Isolated Sign Language Recognition (RoISLR), no large-scale, standardized dataset exists, which limits research progress. In this work, we introduce a new corpus for RoISLR, named RoCoISLR, comprising over 9,000 video samples that span nearly 6,000 standardized glosses from multiple sources. We establish benchmark results by evaluating seven state-of-the-art video recognition models-I3D, SlowFast, Swin Transformer, TimeSformer, Uniformer, VideoMAE, and PoseConv3D-under consistent experimental setups, and compare their performance with that of the widely used WLASL2000 corpus. According to the results, transformer-based architectures outperform convolutional baselines; Swin Transformer achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 34.1%. Our benchmarks highlight the challenges associated with long-tail class distributions in low-resource sign languages, and RoCoISLR provides the initial foundation for systematic RoISLR research.",human
"When simulating partial differential equations, hybrid solvers combine coarse numerical solvers with learned correctors. They promise accelerated simulations while adhering to physical constraints. However, as shown in our theoretical framework, directly applying learned corrections to solver outputs leads to significant autoregressive errors, which originate from amplified perturbations that accumulate during long-term rollouts, especially in chaotic regimes. To overcome this, we propose the Indirect Neural Corrector ($\mathrm{INC}$), which integrates learned corrections into the governing equations rather than applying direct state updates. Our key insight is that $\mathrm{INC}$ reduces the error amplification on the order of $Δt^{-1} + L$, where $Δt$ is the timestep and $L$ the Lipschitz constant. At the same time, our framework poses no architectural requirements and integrates seamlessly with arbitrary neural networks and solvers. We test $\mathrm{INC}$ in extensive benchmarks, covering numerous differentiable solvers, neural backbones, and test cases ranging from a 1D chaotic system to 3D turbulence. $\mathrm{INC}$ improves the long-term trajectory performance ($R^2$) by up to 158.7%, stabilizes blowups under aggressive coarsening, and for complex 3D turbulence cases yields speed-ups of several orders of magnitude. $\mathrm{INC}$ thus enables stable, efficient PDE emulation with formal error reduction, paving the way for faster scientific and engineering simulations with reliable physics guarantees.

"We introduce Conformal Online Learning of Koopman embeddings (COLoKe), a novel framework for adaptively updating Koopman-invariant representations of nonlinear dynamical systems from streaming data. Our modeling approach combines deep feature learning with multistep prediction consistency in the lifted space, where the dynamics evolve linearly. To prevent overfitting, COLoKe employs a conformal-style mechanism that shifts the focus from evaluating the conformity of new states to assessing the consistency of the current Koopman model. Updates are triggered only when the current model's prediction error exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold, allowing selective refinement of the Koopman operator and embedding. Empirical results on benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate the effectiveness of COLoKe in maintaining long-term predictive accuracy while significantly reducing unnecessary updates and avoiding overfitting.",human
"Human memory retrieval often resembles ecological foraging where animals search for food in a patchy environment. Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria.",human
"It can be shown that Stable Diffusion has a permutation-invariance property with respect to the rows of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embedding matrices. This inspired the novel observation that these embeddings can naturally be interpreted as point clouds in a Wasserstein space rather than as matrices in a Euclidean space. This perspective opens up new possibilities for understanding the geometry of embedding space. For example, when interpolating between embeddings of two distinct prompts, we propose reframing the interpolation problem as an optimal transport problem. By solving this optimal transport problem, we compute a shortest path (or geodesic) between embeddings that captures a more natural and geometrically smooth transition through the embedding space. This results in smoother and more coherent intermediate (interpolated) images when rendered by the Stable Diffusion generative model. We conduct experiments to investigate this effect, comparing the quality of interpolated images produced using optimal transport to those generated by other standard interpolation methods. The novel optimal transport--based approach presented indeed gives smoother image interpolations, suggesting that viewing the embeddings as point clouds (rather than as matrices) better reflects and leverages the geometry of the embedding space.",human
"This work introduces Llamazip, a novel lossless text compression algorithm based on the predictive capabilities of the LLaMA3 language model. Llamazip achieves significant data reduction by only storing tokens that the model fails to predict, optimizing storage efficiency without compromising data integrity. Key factors affecting its performance, including quantization and context window size, are analyzed, revealing their impact on compression ratios and computational requirements. Beyond compression, Llamazip demonstrates the potential to identify whether a document was part of the training dataset of a language model. This capability addresses critical concerns about data provenance, intellectual property, and transparency in language model training.",human
"Despite significant progress and advances in autonomous driving, many end-to-end systems still struggle with domain adaptation (DA), such as transferring a policy trained under clear weather to adverse weather conditions. Typical DA strategies in the literature include collecting additional data in the target domain or re-training the model, or both. Both these strategies quickly become impractical as we increase scale and complexity of driving. These limitations have encouraged investigation into few-shot and zero-shot prompt-driven DA at inference time involving LLMs and VLMs. These methods work by adding a few state-action trajectories during inference to the prompt (similar to in-context learning). However, there are two limitations of such an approach: $(i)$ prompt-driven DA methods are currently restricted to perception tasks such as detection and segmentation and $(ii)$ they require expert few-shot data. In this work, we present a new approach to inference-time few-shot prompt-driven DA for closed-loop autonomous driving in adverse weather condition using in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). Similar to other prompt-driven DA methods, our approach does not require any updates to the model parameters nor does it require additional data collection in adversarial weather regime. Furthermore, our approach advances the state-of-the-art in prompt-driven DA by extending to closed driving using general trajectories observed during inference. Our experiments using the CARLA simulator show that ICRL results in safer, more efficient, and more comfortable driving policies in the target domain compared to state-of-the-art prompt-driven DA baselines.",human
"Adaptation is the cornerstone of effective collaboration among heterogeneous team members. In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates.",human
"The Key Value(KV) cache is an important component for efficient inference in autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs), but its role as a representation of the model's internal state makes it a potential target for integrity attacks. This paper introduces ""History Swapping,"" a novel block-level attack that manipulates the KV cache to steer model generation without altering the user-facing prompt. The attack involves overwriting a contiguous segment of the active generation's cache with a precomputed cache from a different topic. We empirically evaluate this method across 324 configurations on the Qwen 3 family of models, analyzing the impact of timing, magnitude, and layer depth of the cache overwrite. Our findings reveal that only full-layer overwrites can successfully hijack the conversation's topic, leading to three distinct behaviors: immediate and persistent topic shift, partial recovery, or a delayed hijack. Furthermore, we observe that high-level structural plans are encoded early in the generation process and local discourse structure is maintained by the final layers of the model. This work demonstrates that the KV cache is a significant vector for security analysis, as it encodes not just context but also topic trajectory and structural planning, making it a powerful interface for manipulating model behavior.",human
"Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks.",human
"Intermittent demand forecasting poses unique challenges due to sparse observations, cold-start items, and obsolescence. Classical models such as Croston, SBA, and the Teunter-Syntetos-Babai (TSB) method provide simple heuristics but lack a principled generative foundation. Deep learning models address these limitations but often require large datasets and sacrifice interpretability.   We introduce TSB-HB, a hierarchical Bayesian extension of TSB. Demand occurrence is modeled with a Beta-Binomial distribution, while nonzero demand sizes follow a Log-Normal distribution. Crucially, hierarchical priors enable partial pooling across items, stabilizing estimates for sparse or cold-start series while preserving heterogeneity. This framework yields a fully generative and interpretable model that generalizes classical exponential smoothing.   On the UCI Online Retail dataset, TSB-HB achieves lower RMSE and RMSSE than Croston, SBA, TSB, ADIDA, IMAPA, ARIMA and Theta, and on a subset of the M5 dataset it outperforms all classical baselines we evaluate. The model provides calibrated probabilistic forecasts and improved accuracy on intermittent and lumpy items by combining a generative formulation with hierarchical shrinkage, while remaining interpretable and scalable.",human
"Scientific datasets often arise from multiple independent mechanisms such as spatial, categorical or structural effects, whose combined influence obscures their individual contributions. We introduce DIVIDE, a framework that disentangles these influences by integrating mechanism-specific deep encoders with a structured Gaussian Process in a joint latent space. Disentanglement here refers to separating independently acting generative factors. The encoders isolate distinct mechanisms while the Gaussian Process captures their combined effect with calibrated uncertainty. The architecture supports structured priors, enabling interpretable and mechanism-aware prediction as well as efficient active learning. DIVIDE is demonstrated on synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches with nonlinear spatial fields, on FerroSIM spin lattice simulations of ferroelectric patterns, and on experimental PFM hysteresis loops from PbTiO3 films. Across benchmarks, DIVIDE separates mechanisms, reproduces additive and scaled interactions, and remains robust under noise. The framework extends naturally to multifunctional datasets where mechanical, electromagnetic or optical responses coexist.",human
"As synthetic data proliferates across the Internet, it is often reused to train successive generations of generative models. This creates a ``self-consuming loop"" that can lead to training instability or \textit{model collapse}. Common strategies to address the issue -- such as accumulating historical training data or injecting fresh real data -- either increase computational cost or require expensive human annotation. In this paper, we empirically analyze the latent space dynamics of self-consuming diffusion models and observe that the low-dimensional structure of latent representations extracted from synthetic data degrade over generations. Based on this insight, we propose \textit{Latent Space Filtering} (LSF), a novel approach that mitigates model collapse by filtering out less realistic synthetic data from mixed datasets. Theoretically, we present a framework that connects latent space degradation to empirical observations. Experimentally, we show that LSF consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple real-world datasets, effectively mitigating model collapse without increasing training cost or relying on human annotation.",human
"The performance of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) is critically dependent on the relevance and quality of the datasets used for training and evaluation. However, current AI model evaluation practices for developing IDS/IPS focus predominantly on accuracy metrics, often overlooking whether datasets represent industry-specific threats. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments. The efficiency and practicality of the framework are validated through deployment in a real-world case study, underscoring its capacity to inform dataset selection and enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS in operational environments.",human
"Understanding customer attitudes has become a critical component of decision-making due to the growing influence of social media and e-commerce. Text-based opinions are the most structured, hence playing an important role in sentiment analysis. Most of the existing methods, which include lexicon-based approaches and traditional machine learning techniques, are insufficient for handling contextual nuances and scalability. While the latter has limitations in model performance and generalization, deep learning (DL) has achieved improvement, especially on semantic relationship capturing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim of the study is to enhance opinion mining by introducing a hybrid deep neural network model that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to improve sentiment analysis, particularly addressing challenges such as contextual nuance, scalability, and class imbalance. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing benchmark datasets, encompassing IMDB movie critiques and Amazon product evaluations. The introduced hybrid BGRULSTM (HBGRU-LSTM) architecture attained a testing accuracy of 95%, exceeding the performance of traditional DL frameworks such as LSTM (93.06%), CNN+LSTM (93.31%), and GRU+LSTM (92.20%). Moreover, our model exhibited a noteworthy enhancement in recall for negative sentiments, escalating from 86% (unbalanced dataset) to 96% (balanced dataset), thereby ensuring a more equitable and just sentiment classification. Furthermore, the model diminished misclassification loss from 20.24% for unbalanced to 13.3% for balanced dataset, signifying enhanced generalization and resilience.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) achieve superhuman performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often fail on much simpler problems, raising concerns about their reliability and interpretability. We investigate this paradox through a focused study with two key design features: simplicity, to expose basic failure modes, and scale, to enable comprehensive controlled experiments. We focus on set membership queries -- among the most fundamental forms of reasoning -- using tasks like ``Is apple an element of the set \{pear, plum, apple, raspberry\}?''. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation across prompt phrasing, semantic structure, element ordering, and model choice. Our large-scale analysis reveals that LLM performance on this elementary task is consistently brittle, and unpredictable across all dimensions, suggesting that the models' ``understanding'' of the set concept is fragmented and convoluted at best. Our work demonstrates that the large-scale experiments enabled by the simplicity of the problem allow us to map and analyze the failure modes comprehensively, making this approach a valuable methodology for LLM evaluation in general.",human
"A method for creating a forest of model trees to fit samples of a function defined on images is described in several steps: down-sampling the images, determining a tree's hyperplanes, applying convolutions to the hyperplanes to handle small distortions of training images, and creating forests of model trees to increase accuracy and achieve a smooth fit. A 1-to-1 correspondence among pixels of images, coefficients of hyperplanes and coefficients of leaf functions offers the possibility of dealing with larger distortions such as arbitrary rotations or changes of perspective. A theoretical method for smoothing forest outputs to produce a continuously differentiable approximation is described. Within that framework, a training procedure is proved to converge.",human
"Deep neural networks typically rely on the representation produced by their final hidden layer to make predictions, implicitly assuming that this single vector fully captures the semantics encoded across all preceding transformations. However, intermediate layers contain rich and complementary information -- ranging from low-level patterns to high-level abstractions -- that is often discarded when the decision head depends solely on the last representation. This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations. The code to reproduce LAYA is publicly available at: https://github.com/gvessio/LAYA.",human
"Data poisoning is a training-time attack that undermines the trustworthiness of learned models. In a targeted data poisoning attack, an adversary manipulates the training dataset to alter the classification of a targeted test point. Given the typically large size of training dataset, manual detection of poisoning is difficult. An alternative is to automatically measure a dataset's robustness against such an attack, which is the focus of this paper. We consider a threat model wherein an adversary can only perturb the labels of the training dataset, with knowledge limited to the hypothesis space of the victim's model. In this setting, we prove that finding the robustness is an NP-Complete problem, even when hypotheses are linear classifiers. To overcome this, we present a technique that finds lower and upper bounds of robustness. Our implementation of the technique computes these bounds efficiently in practice for many publicly available datasets. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, a poisoning exceeding the identified robustness bounds significantly impacts test point classification. We are also able to compute these bounds in many more cases where state-of-the-art techniques fail.",human
"Proteins perform essential biological functions, and accurate classification of their sequences is critical for understanding structure-function relationships, enzyme mechanisms, and molecular interactions. This study presents a deep learning-based framework for functional group classification of protein sequences derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Four architectures were implemented: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), CNN-BiLSTM hybrid, and CNN with Attention. Each model was trained using k-mer integer encoding to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Among these, the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of localized motif detection. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, were applied to interpret model predictions and identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs. The discovered motifs, enriched in histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine, represent amino acid residues commonly found in catalytic and metal-binding regions of transferase enzymes. These findings highlight that deep learning models can uncover functionally relevant biochemical signatures, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and biological interpretability in protein sequence analysis.",human
"Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.",human
"Bipartite learning is a machine learning task that aims to predict interactions between pairs of instances. It has been applied to various domains, including drug-target interactions, RNA-disease associations, and regulatory network inference. Despite being widely investigated, current methods still present drawbacks, as they are often designed for a specific application and thus do not generalize to other problems or present scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose Oxytrees: proxy-based biclustering model trees. Oxytrees compress the interaction matrix into row- and column-wise proxy matrices, significantly reducing training time without compromising predictive performance. We also propose a new leaf-assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the time taken for prediction. Finally, Oxytrees employ linear models using the Kronecker product kernel in their leaves, resulting in shallower trees and thus even faster training. Using 15 datasets, we compared the predictive performance of ensembles of Oxytrees with that of the current state-of-the-art. We achieved up to 30-fold improvement in training times compared to state-of-the-art biclustering forests, while demonstrating competitive or superior performance in most evaluation settings, particularly in the inductive setting. Finally, we provide an intuitive Python API to access all datasets, methods and evaluation measures used in this work, thus enabling reproducible research in this field.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn dialogue settings, but their behavior is still bottlenecked by fixed context windows and naive memory strategies. Replaying the full conversation at every turn is simple but expensive, while static summarization or recency-only heuristics often erase safety-critical user details. We present Adaptive Focus Memory (AFM), a dynamic context manager that assigns each past message one of three fidelity levels -- FULL, COMPRESSED, or PLACEHOLDER -- based on semantic similarity to the current query, half-life recency weighting, and importance classification. AFM packs messages chronologically under a strict token budget, preferring high fidelity for the most relevant turns while aiming to preserve a cheap trace of the dialogue. In a safety-oriented benchmark involving a user with a severe peanut allergy planning a trip to Thailand, AFM retains the allergy across both short and medium-length conversations, matches the safety performance of naive replay, and cuts average token usage by 66% relative to a replay baseline. We release a modular Python implementation of AFM designed for OpenAI-compatible APIs and offline operation, enabling practitioners to reduce inference cost without sacrificing safety or factual continuity in the evaluated scenario.",human
"Automated red teaming frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, yet they share a fundamental limitation: their jailbreak logic is confined to selecting, combining, or refining pre-existing attack strategies. This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods. We release our framework to facilitate future research in this new direction of evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/dongdongunique/EvoSynth.",human
"Mesh-based simulation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been recognized as a promising approach for modeling fluid dynamics. However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.",human
"Training general agents to follow complex instructions (tasks) in intricate environments (levels) remains a core challenge in reinforcement learning. Random sampling of task-level pairs often produces unsolvable combinations, highlighting the need to co-design tasks and levels. While unsupervised environment design (UED) has proven effective at automatically designing level curricula, prior work has only considered a fixed task. We present ATLAS (Aligning Tasks and Levels for Autocurricula of Specifications), a novel method that generates joint autocurricula over tasks and levels. Our approach builds upon UED to automatically produce solvable yet challenging task-level pairs for policy training. To evaluate ATLAS and drive progress in the field, we introduce an evaluation suite that models tasks as reward machines in Minigrid levels. Experiments demonstrate that ATLAS vastly outperforms random sampling approaches, particularly when sampling solvable pairs is unlikely. We further show that mutations leveraging the structure of both tasks and levels accelerate convergence to performant policies.",human
"This paper describes GeoPl@ntNet, an interactive web application designed to make Essential Biodiversity Variables accessible and understandable to everyone through dynamic maps and fact sheets. Its core purpose is to allow users to explore high-resolution AI-generated maps of species distributions, habitat types, and biodiversity indicators across Europe. These maps, developed through a cascading pipeline involving convolutional neural networks and large language models, provide an intuitive yet information-rich interface to better understand biodiversity, with resolutions as precise as 50x50 meters. The website also enables exploration of specific regions, allowing users to select areas of interest on the map (e.g., urban green spaces, protected areas, or riverbanks) to view local species and their coverage. Additionally, GeoPl@ntNet generates comprehensive reports for selected regions, including insights into the number of protected species, invasive species, and endemic species.",human
"Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized, privacy-preserving model training but struggles to balance global generalization and local personalization due to non-identical data distributions across clients. Personalized Fine-Tuning (PFT), a popular post-hoc solution, fine-tunes the final global model locally but often overfits to skewed client distributions or fails under domain shifts. We propose adapting Linear Probing followed by full Fine-Tuning (LP-FT), a principled centralized strategy for alleviating feature distortion (Kumar et al., 2022), to the FL setting. Through systematic evaluation across seven datasets and six PFT variants, we demonstrate LP-FT's superiority in balancing personalization and generalization. Our analysis uncovers federated feature distortion, a phenomenon where local fine-tuning destabilizes globally learned features, and theoretically characterizes how LP-FT mitigates this via phased parameter updates. We further establish conditions (e.g., partial feature overlap, covariate-concept shift) under which LP-FT outperforms standard fine-tuning, offering actionable guidelines for deploying robust personalization in FL.",human
"State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear computational complexity while achieving competitive performance. Yet, despite their effectiveness, understanding how these Vision SSMs process spatial information remains challenging due to the lack of transparent, attention-like mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks. Our framework establishes controllability analysis as a unified, foundational interpretability paradigm for SSMs across all domains. Code and analysis tools will be made available upon publication",human
"Vision-language models (VLMs) enable open-ended visual question answering but remain prone to hallucinations. We present HEDGE, a unified framework for hallucination detection that combines controlled visual perturbations, semantic clustering, and robust uncertainty metrics. HEDGE integrates sampling, distortion synthesis, clustering (entailment- and embedding-based), and metric computation into a reproducible pipeline applicable across multimodal architectures.   Evaluations on VQA-RAD and KvasirVQA-x1 with three representative VLMs (LLaVA-Med, Med-Gemma, Qwen2.5-VL) reveal clear architecture- and prompt-dependent trends. Hallucination detectability is highest for unified-fusion models with dense visual tokenization (Qwen2.5-VL) and lowest for architectures with restricted tokenization (Med-Gemma). Embedding-based clustering often yields stronger separation when applied directly to the generated answers, whereas NLI-based clustering remains advantageous for LLaVA-Med and for longer, sentence-level responses. Across configurations, the VASE metric consistently provides the most robust hallucination signal, especially when paired with embedding clustering and a moderate sampling budget (n ~ 10-15). Prompt design also matters: concise, label-style outputs offer clearer semantic structure than syntactically constrained one-sentence responses.   By framing hallucination detection as a geometric robustness problem shaped jointly by sampling scale, prompt structure, model architecture, and clustering strategy, HEDGE provides a principled, compute-aware foundation for evaluating multimodal reliability. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE .",human
"Foundation models for medical image segmentation struggle under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, often producing fragmented false positives on OOD tumors. We introduce R$^{2}$Seg, a training-free framework for robust OOD tumor segmentation that operates via a two-stage Reason-and-Reject process. First, the Reason step employs an LLM-guided anatomical reasoning planner to localize organ anchors and generate multi-scale ROIs. Second, the Reject step applies two-sample statistical testing to candidates generated by a frozen foundation model (BiomedParse) within these ROIs. This statistical rejection filter retains only candidates significantly different from normal tissue, effectively suppressing false positives. Our framework requires no parameter updates, making it compatible with zero-update test-time augmentation and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. On multi-center and multi-modal tumor segmentation benchmarks, R$^{2}$Seg substantially improves Dice, specificity, and sensitivity over strong baselines and the original foundation models. Code are available at https://github.com/Eurekashen/R2Seg.",human
"Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components are trained jointly, is an attractive alternative to cascaded systems because it offers a simpler pipeline and lower inference latency. However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English",human
"In this paper, we study the finite-sample statistical rates of distributional temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation. The purpose of distributional TD learning is to estimate the return distribution of a discounted Markov decision process for a given policy. Previous works on statistical analysis of distributional TD learning focus mainly on the tabular case. We first consider the linear function approximation setting and conduct a fine-grained analysis of the linear-categorical Bellman equation. Building on this analysis, we further incorporate variance reduction techniques in our new algorithms to establish tight sample complexity bounds independent of the support size $K$ when $K$ is large. Our theoretical results imply that, when employing distributional TD learning with linear function approximation, learning the full distribution of the return function from streaming data is no more difficult than learning its expectation. This work provide new insights into the statistical efficiency of distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.",human
"Weather prediction is a quintessential problem involving the forecasting of a complex, nonlinear, and chaotic high-dimensional dynamical system. This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.",human
"Multilingual LLMs demonstrate strong performance across diverse languages, yet there has been limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured within their internal representation space and how it emerges across layers. We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\%, revealing a 4.21$\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

"A central challenge in scaling up explicit state-space search for large tasks is compactly representing the set of generated states. Tree databases, a data structure from model checking, require constant space per generated state in the best case, but they need a large preallocation of memory. We propose a novel dynamic variant of tree databases for compressing state sets over propositional and numeric variables and prove that it maintains the desirable properties of the static counterpart. Our empirical evaluation of state compression techniques for grounded and lifted planning on classical and numeric planning tasks reveals compression ratios of several orders of magnitude, often with negligible runtime overhead.",human
"Deploying embodied agents that can answer questions about their surroundings in realistic real-world settings remains difficult, partly due to the scarcity of benchmarks that faithfully capture practical operating conditions. We propose infrastructure inspection as a compelling domain for open-vocabulary Embodied Question Answering (EQA): it naturally demands multi-scale reasoning, long-range spatial understanding, and complex semantic relationships, while offering unique evaluation advantages via standardized National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings (0-9), professional inspection reports, and egocentric imagery.   We introduce BridgeEQA, a benchmark of 2,200 open-vocabulary question-answer pairs (in the style of OpenEQA) grounded in professional inspection reports across 200 real-world bridge scenes with 47.93 images on average per scene. Questions require synthesizing visual evidence across multiple images and aligning responses with NBI condition ratings. We further propose a new EQA metric Image Citation Relevance to evaluate the ability of a model to cite relevant images.   Evaluations of state-of-the-art vision-language models reveal substantial performance gaps under episodic memory EQA settings. To address this, we propose Embodied Memory Visual Reasoning (EMVR), which formulates inspection as sequential navigation over an image-based scene graph: images are nodes, and an agent takes actions to traverse views, compare evidence, and reason within a Markov decision process. EMVR shows strong performance over the baselines. We publicly release both the dataset and code.",human
"Stickers are widely used in online communication to convey emotions and implicit intentions. The Sticker Response Selection (SRS) task aims to select the most contextually appropriate sticker based on the dialogue. However, existing methods typically rely on semantic matching and model emotional and intentional cues separately, which can lead to mismatches when emotions and intentions are misaligned. To address this issue, we propose Emotion and Intention Guided Multi-Modal Learning (EIGML). This framework is the first to jointly model emotion and intention, effectively reducing the bias caused by isolated modeling and significantly improving selection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Dual-Level Contrastive Framework to perform both intra-modality and inter-modality alignment, ensuring consistent representation of emotional and intentional features within and across modalities. In addition, we design an Intention-Emotion Guided Multi-Modal Fusion module that integrates emotional and intentional information progressively through three components: Emotion-Guided Intention Knowledge Selection, Intention-Emotion Guided Attention Fusion, and Similarity-Adjusted Matching Mechanism. This design injects rich, effective information into the model and enables a deeper understanding of the dialogue, ultimately enhancing sticker selection performance. Experimental results on two public SRS datasets show that EIGML consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy and a better understanding of emotional and intentional features.

"Assurance for artificial intelligence (AI) systems remains fragmented across software supply-chain security, adversarial machine learning, and governance documentation. Existing transparency mechanisms - including Model Cards, Datasheets, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) - advance provenance reporting but rarely provide verifiable, machine-readable evidence of model security. This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields. The AIRS Framework thus extends SBOM practice to the AI domain by coupling threat modeling with automated, auditable evidence generation, providing a principled foundation for standardized, trustworthy, and machine-verifiable AI risk documentation.",human
"Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model while preserving the privacy of their local data. Within this paradigm, the intellectual property rights (IPR) of client models are critical assets that must be protected. In practice, the central server responsible for maintaining the global model may maliciously manipulate the global model to erase client contributions or falsely claim sole ownership, thereby infringing on clients' IPR. Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for asserting model ownership and protecting intellectual property. However, existing FL watermarking approaches remain limited, suffering from potential watermark collisions among clients, insufficient watermark security, and non-intuitive verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FLClear, a novel framework that simultaneously achieves collision-free watermark aggregation, enhanced watermark security, and visually interpretable ownership verification. Specifically, FLClear introduces a transposed model jointly optimized with contrastive learning to integrate the watermarking and main task objectives. During verification, the watermark is reconstructed from the transposed model and evaluated through both visual inspection and structural similarity metrics, enabling intuitive and quantitative ownership verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted over various datasets, aggregation schemes, and attack scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FLClear and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL watermarking methods.",human
"Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to be faithful to new knowledge in complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks is a critical, yet unsolved, challenge. We find that SFT-based methods, e.g., Reason-KE, while state-of-the-art, suffer from a ""faithfulness gap"": they optimize for format mimicry rather than sound reasoning. This gap enables the LLM's powerful parametric priors to override new contextual facts, resulting in critical factual hallucinations (e.g., incorrectly reasoning ""Houston"" from ""NASA"" despite an explicit edit). To solve this core LLM alignment problem, we propose Reason-KE++, an SFT+RL framework that instills process-level faithfulness. Its core is a Stage-aware Reward mechanism that provides dense supervision for intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Decomposition, Sub-answer Correctness). Crucially, we identify that naive outcome-only RL is a deceptive trap for LLM alignment: it collapses reasoning integrity (e.g., 19.00% Hop acc) while superficially boosting final accuracy. Our process-aware framework sets a new SOTA of 95.48% on MQUAKE-CF-3k (+5.28%), demonstrating that for complex tasks, aligning the reasoning process is essential for building trustworthy LLMs.",human
"The fundamental theorem of statistical learning states that binary PAC learning is governed by a single parameter -- the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension -- which determines both learnability and sample complexity. Extending this to multiclass classification has long been challenging, since Natarajan's work in the late 80s proposing the Natarajan dimension (Nat) as a natural analogue of VC. Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014) introduced the DS dimension, later shown by Brukhim et al. (2022) to characterize multiclass learnability. Brukhim et al. also showed that Nat and DS can diverge arbitrarily, suggesting that multiclass learning is governed by DS rather than Nat. We show that agnostic multiclass PAC sample complexity is in fact governed by two distinct dimensions. Specifically, we prove nearly tight agnostic sample complexity bounds that, up to log factors, take the form $\frac{DS^{1.5}}ε + \frac{Nat}{ε^2}$ where $ε$ is the excess risk. This bound is tight up to a $\sqrt{DS}$ factor in the first term, nearly matching known $Nat/ε^2$ and $DS/ε$ lower bounds. The first term reflects the DS-controlled regime, while the second shows that the Natarajan dimension still dictates asymptotic behavior for small $ε$. Thus, unlike binary or online classification -- where a single dimension (VC or Littlestone) controls both phenomena -- multiclass learning inherently involves two structural parameters. Our technical approach departs from traditional agnostic learning methods based on uniform convergence or reductions to realizable cases. A key ingredient is a novel online procedure based on a self-adaptive multiplicative-weights algorithm performing a label-space reduction, which may be of independent interest.",human
"The security of autonomous vehicle networks is facing major challenges, owing to the complexity of sensor integration, real-time performance demands, and distributed communication protocols that expose vast attack surfaces around both individual and network-wide safety. Existing security schemes are unable to provide sub-10 ms (milliseconds) anomaly detection and distributed coordination of large-scale networks of vehicles within an acceptable safety/privacy framework. This paper introduces a three-tier hybrid security architecture HAVEN (Hierarchical Autonomous Vehicle Enhanced Network), which decouples real-time local threat detection and distributed coordination operations. It incorporates a light ensemble anomaly detection model on the edge (first layer), Byzantine-fault-tolerant federated learning to aggregate threat intelligence at a regional scale (middle layer), and selected blockchain mechanisms (top layer) to ensure critical security coordination. Extensive experimentation is done on a real-world autonomous driving dataset. Large-scale simulations with the number of vehicles ranging between 100 and 1000 and different attack types, such as sensor spoofing, jamming, and adversarial model poisoning, are conducted to test the scalability and resiliency of HAVEN. Experimental findings show sub-10 ms detection latency with an accuracy of 94% and F1-score of 92% across multimodal sensor data, Byzantine fault tolerance validated with 20\% compromised nodes, and a reduced blockchain storage overhead, guaranteeing sufficient differential privacy. The proposed framework overcomes the important trade-off between real-time safety obligation and distributed security coordination with novel three-tiered processing. The scalable architecture of HAVEN is shown to provide great improvement in detection accuracy as well as network resilience over other methods.",human
"Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the security of large language models (LLMs), causing them to exhibit anomalous behavior under specific trigger conditions. The design of backdoor triggers has evolved from fixed triggers to dynamic or implicit triggers. This increased flexibility in trigger design makes it challenging for defenders to identify their specific forms accurately. Most existing backdoor defense methods are limited to specific types of triggers or rely on an additional clean model for support. To address this issue, we propose a backdoor detection method based on attention similarity, enabling backdoor detection without prior knowledge of the trigger. Our study reveals that models subjected to backdoor attacks exhibit unusually high similarity among attention heads when exposed to triggers. Based on this observation, we propose an attention safety alignment approach combined with head-wise fine-tuning to rectify potentially contaminated attention heads, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of backdoor attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the success rate of backdoor attacks while preserving the model's performance on downstream tasks.",human
"This article revisits the 20-year-old neural fitted Q-iteration (NFQ) algorithm on its classical CartPole benchmark. NFQ was a pioneering approach towards modern Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) in applying multi-layer neural networks to reinforcement learning for real-world control problems. We explore the algorithm's conceptual simplicity and its transition from online to batch learning, which contributed to its stability. Despite its initial success, NFQ required extensive tuning and was not easily reproducible on real-world control problems. We propose a modernized variant NFQ2.0 and apply it to the CartPole task, concentrating on a real-world system build from standard industrial components, to investigate and improve the learning process's repeatability and robustness. Through ablation studies, we highlight key design decisions and hyperparameters that enhance performance and stability of NFQ2.0 over the original variant. Finally, we demonstrate how our findings can assist practitioners in reproducing and improving results and applying deep reinforcement learning more effectively in industrial contexts.",human
"Web Application Firewalls are crucial for protecting web applications against a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Web Application Firewalls often struggle to effectively distinguish between malicious and legitimate traffic, leading to limited efficacy in threat detection. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an Adaptive Dual-Layer WAF employing a two-layered Machine Learning model designed to enhance the accuracy of anomaly and threat detection. The first layer employs a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to detect anomalies by identifying traffic deviations from established normal patterns. The second layer employs Support Vector Machine to classify these anomalies as either threat anomalies or benign anomalies. Our Adaptive Dual Layer WAF incorporates comprehensive data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques and has been thoroughly evaluated using five large benchmark datasets. Evaluation using these datasets shows that ADL WAF achieves a detection accuracy of 99.88% and a precision of 100%, significantly enhancing anomaly detection and reducing false positives. These findings suggest that integrating machine learning techniques into WAFs can substantially improve web application security by providing more accurate and efficient threat detection.",human
"Upgrades to current gravitational wave detectors for the next observation run and upcoming third-generation observatories, like the Einstein telescope, are expected to have enormous improvements in detection sensitivities and compact object merger event rates. Estimation of source parameters for a wider parameter space that these detectable signals will lie in, will be a computational challenge. Thus, it is imperative to have methods to speed-up the likelihood calculations with theoretical waveform predictions, which can ultimately make the parameter estimation faster and aid in rapid multi-messenger follow-ups. Towards this end, we present a conditional variational auto-encoder model, based on the best performing architecture of Liao+2021, for faster generation of aligned-spin SEOBNRv4 inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. Our parameter space consists of four parameters, [$m_1$, $m_2$, $χ_1(z)$, $χ_2(z)$]. The masses are uniformly sampled in $[5,75]\,M_{\odot}$ with a mass ratio limit at $10\,M_{\odot}$, while the spins are uniform in $[-0.99,0.99]$. We train the model using $\sim10^5$ input waveforms data with a 70\%/10\% train/validation split, while 20\% data are reserved for testing. The median mismatch for the generated waveforms in the test dataset is $\sim10^{-2}$, with better performance in a restricted parameter space of $χ_{\rm eff}\in[-0.80,0.80]$. Our model is able to generate 100 waveforms in 0.1 second at an average speed of about 4.46 ms per waveform. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the native SEOBNRv4 implementation in lalsimulation. The latent sampling uncertainty of our model can be quantified with a mean mismatch deviation of $2\times10^{-1}$ for 1000 generations of the same waveform. Our work aims to be the first step towards developing a production-ready machine learning framework for the faster generation of gravitational waveform approximations.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.",human
"The consensus strategies used in collaborative multi-agent systems (MAS) face notable challenges related to adaptability, scalability, and convergence certainties. These approaches, including structured workflows, debate models, and iterative voting, often lead to communication bottlenecks, stringent decision-making processes, and delayed responses in solving complex and evolving tasks. This article introduces a three-tier architecture, the Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network (\hacn), which suggests various consensus policies based on task characterization and agent performance metrics. The first layer collects the confidence-based voting outcomes of several local agent clusters. In contrast, the second level facilitates inter-cluster communication through cross-clustered partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts. The third layer provides system-wide coordination and final arbitration by employing a global orchestration framework with adaptable decision rules. The proposed model achieves $\bigO(n)$ communication complexity, as opposed to the $\bigO(n^2)$ complexity of the existing fully connected MAS. Experiments performed in a simulated environment yielded a 99.9\% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures consensus convergence through hierarchical escalation and dynamic adaptation for a wide variety of complicated tasks.",human
"Context: Large language models (LLMs) are released faster than users' ability to evaluate them rigorously. When LLMs underpin research, such as identifying relevant literature for systematic reviews (SRs), robust empirical assessment is essential. Objective: We identify and discuss key challenges in assessing LLM performance for selecting relevant literature, identify good (evaluation) practices, and propose recommendations. Method: Using a recent large-scale study as an example, we identify problems with the use of traditional metrics for assessing the performance of Gen-AI tools for identifying relevant literature in SRs. We analyzed 27 additional papers investigating this issue, extracted the performance metrics, and found both good practices and widespread problems, especially with the use and reporting of performance metrics for SR screening. Results: Major weaknesses included: i) a failure to use metrics that are robust to imbalanced data and do not directly indicate whether results are better than chance, e.g., the use of Accuracy, ii) a failure to consider the impact of lost evidence when making claims concerning workload savings, and iii) pervasive failure to report the full confusion matrix (or performance metrics from which it can be reconstructed) which is essential for future meta-analyses. On the positive side, we extract good (evaluation) practices on which our recommendations for researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers, are built. Conclusions: SR screening evaluations should prioritize lost evidence/recall alongside chance-anchored and cost-sensitive Weighted MCC (WMCC) metric, report complete confusion matrices, treat unclassifiable outputs as referred-back positives for assessment, adopt leakage-aware designs with non-LLM baselines and open artifacts, and ground conclusions in cost-benefit analysis where FNs carry higher penalties than FPs.",human
"While significant progress has been achieved in multimodal facial generation using semantic masks and textual descriptions, conventional feature fusion approaches often fail to enable effective cross-modal interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal generation outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce MDiTFace--a customized diffusion transformer framework that employs a unified tokenization strategy to process semantic mask and text inputs, eliminating discrepancies between heterogeneous modality representations. The framework facilitates comprehensive multimodal feature interaction through stacked, newly designed multivariate transformer blocks that process all conditions synchronously. Additionally, we design a novel decoupled attention mechanism by dissociating implicit dependencies between mask tokens and temporal embeddings. This mechanism segregates internal computations into dynamic and static pathways, enabling caching and reuse of features computed in static pathways after initial calculation, thereby reducing additional computational overhead introduced by mask condition by over 94% while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDiTFace significantly outperforms other competing methods in terms of both facial fidelity and conditional consistency.",human
"Notice to Air Missions (NOTAMs) serve as a critical channel for disseminating key flight safety information, yet their complex linguistic structures and implicit reasoning pose significant challenges for automated parsing. Existing research mainly focuses on surface-level tasks such as classification and named entity recognition, lacking deep semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose NOTAM semantic parsing, a task emphasizing semantic inference and the integration of aviation domain knowledge to produce structured, inference-rich outputs. To support this task, we construct Knots (Knowledge and NOTAM Semantics), a high-quality dataset of 12,347 expert-annotated NOTAMs covering 194 Flight Information Regions, enhanced through a multi-agent collaborative framework for comprehensive field discovery. We systematically evaluate a wide range of prompt-engineering strategies and model-adaptation techniques, achieving substantial improvements in aviation text understanding and processing. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and offer valuable insights for automated NOTAM analysis systems.

"Current federated-learning models deteriorate under heterogeneous (non-I.I.D.) client data, as their feature representations diverge and pixel- or patch-level objectives fail to capture the global topology which is essential for high-dimensional visual tasks. We propose FedTopo, a framework that integrates Topological-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) and Topological Embedding (TE) to leverage topological information, yielding coherently aligned cross-client representations by Topological Alignment Loss (TAL). First, Topology-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) automatically selects the most topology-informative block, i.e., the one with maximal topological separability, whose persistence-based signatures best distinguish within- versus between-class pairs, ensuring that subsequent analysis focuses on topology-rich features. Next, this block yields a compact Topological Embedding, which quantifies the topological information for each client. Finally, a Topological Alignment Loss (TAL) guides clients to maintain topological consistency with the global model during optimization, reducing representation drift across rounds. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under four non-I.I.D. partitions show that FedTopo accelerates convergence and improves accuracy over strong baselines.",human
"Camouflaged object detection identifies objects that blend seamlessly with their surroundings through similar colors, textures, and patterns. This task challenges both traditional segmentation methods and modern foundation models, which fail dramatically on camouflaged objects. We identify six fundamental challenges in COD: Intrinsic Similarity, Edge Disruption, Extreme Scale Variation, Environmental Complexities, Contextual Dependencies, and Salient-Camouflaged Object Disambiguation. These challenges frequently co-occur and compound the difficulty of detection, requiring comprehensive architectural solutions. We propose C3Net, which addresses all challenges through a specialized dual-pathway decoder architecture. The Edge Refinement Pathway employs gradient-initialized Edge Enhancement Modules to recover precise boundaries from early features. The Contextual Localization Pathway utilizes our novel Image-based Context Guidance mechanism to achieve intrinsic saliency suppression without external models. An Attentive Fusion Module synergistically combines the two pathways via spatial gating. C3Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with S-measures of 0.898 on COD10K, 0.904 on CAMO, and 0.913 on NC4K, while maintaining efficient processing. C3Net demonstrates that complex, multifaceted detection challenges require architectural innovation, with specialized components working synergistically to achieve comprehensive coverage beyond isolated improvements.

"We introduce a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates object detection and pose estimation with a versatile onboarding process. Our pipeline begins with an onboarding stage that generates object representations from either traditional 3D CAD models or, in their absence, by rapidly reconstructing a high-fidelity neural representation (NeRF) from multi-view images. Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS). A decoder then establishes robust 2D-3D correspondences to determine the final pose. Evaluated on the challenging BOP benchmarks, our integrated system demonstrates a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency, showcasing its practical applicability in both model-based and model-free scenarios.",human
"We present Uni-MoE 2.0 from the Lychee family. As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.",human
"In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.   Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.",human
"Langevin dynamics sampling suffers from extremely low generation speed, fundamentally limited by numerous fine-grained iterations to converge to the target distribution. We introduce PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics (PIDLD), a novel sampling acceleration algorithm that reinterprets the sampling process using control-theoretic principles. By treating energy gradients as feedback signals, PIDLD combines historical gradients (the integral term) and gradient trends (the derivative term) to efficiently traverse energy landscapes and adaptively stabilize, thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to produce high-quality samples. Our approach requires no additional training, datasets, or prior information, making it immediately integrable with any Langevin-based method. Extensive experiments across image generation and reasoning tasks demonstrate that PIDLD achieves higher quality with fewer steps, making Langevin-based generative models more practical for efficiency-critical applications. The implementation can be found at \href{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PIDLD}{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PIDLD}.",human
"Neural network parameterizations exhibit inherent symmetries that yield multiple equivalent minima within the loss landscape. Scale Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) explicitly leverage these symmetries by proposing an architecture equivariant to both permutation and parameter scaling transformations. Previous work by Ainsworth et al. (2023) addressed permutation symmetries through a computationally intensive combinatorial assignment problem, demonstrating that leveraging permutation symmetries alone can map networks into a shared loss basin. In this work, we extend their approach by also incorporating scaling symmetries, presenting an autoencoder framework utilizing ScaleGMNs as invariant encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method aligns Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) under both permutation and scaling symmetries without explicitly solving the assignment problem. This approach ensures that similar networks naturally converge within the same basin, facilitating model merging, i.e., smooth linear interpolation while avoiding regions of high loss. The code is publicly available on our GitHub repository.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from mode collapse, repeatedly generating the same few completions even when many valid answers exist, limiting their diversity across a wide range of tasks. We introduce Group-Aware Policy Optimization (GAPO), a simple extension of the recent and popular Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that computes rewards over the group as a whole. GAPO enables learning from the group-level properties such as diversity and coverage. We demonstrate GAPO using a frequency-aware reward function that encourages uniform sampling over valid LLM completions, and show that GAPO-trained models produce valid and more diverse model responses. Beyond this setup, GAPO generalizes to open-ended prompts and improves response diversity without compromising accuracy on standard LLM benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MMLU-Pro). Our code will be made publicly available.",human
"Low latency event-selection (trigger) algorithms are essential components of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) operation. Modern machine learning (ML) models have shown great offline performance as classifiers and could improve trigger performance, thereby improving downstream physics analyses. However, inference on such large models does not satisfy the $40\text{MHz}$ online latency constraint at the LHC. In this work, we propose \texttt{PHAZE}, a novel framework built on cryptographic techniques like hashing and zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) to achieve low latency inference, via a certifiable, early-exit mechanism from an arbitrarily large baseline model. We lay the foundations for such a framework to achieve nanosecond-order latency and discuss its inherent advantages, such as built-in anomaly detection, within the scope of LHC triggers, as well as its potential to enable a dynamic low-level trigger in the future.",human
"Precise modeling of lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, as it directly impacts navigation and control decisions. Existing methods typically represent each lane with a single query and infer topological connectivity based on the similarity between lane queries. However, this kind of design struggles to accurately model complex lane structures, leading to unreliable topology prediction. In this view, we propose a Fine-Grained lane topology reasoning framework (TopoFG). It divides the procedure from bird's-eye-view (BEV) features to topology prediction via fine-grained queries into three phases, i.e., Hierarchical Prior Extractor (HPE), Region-Focused Decoder (RFD), and Robust Boundary-Point Topology Reasoning (RBTR). Specifically, HPE extracts global spatial priors from the BEV mask and local sequential priors from in-lane keypoint sequences to guide subsequent fine-grained query modeling. RFD constructs fine-grained queries by integrating the spatial and sequential priors. It then samples reference points in RoI regions of the mask and applies cross-attention with BEV features to refine the query representations of each lane. RBTR models lane connectivity based on boundary-point query features and further employs a topological denoising strategy to reduce matching ambiguity. By integrating spatial and sequential priors into fine-grained queries and applying a denoising strategy to boundary-point topology reasoning, our method precisely models complex lane structures and delivers trustworthy topology predictions. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TopoFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with an OLS of 48.0 on subsetA and 45.4 on subsetB.",human
"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), especially temporally resolved datasets, enables genome-wide profiling of gene expression dynamics at single-cell resolution across discrete time points. However, current technologies provide only sparse, static snapshots of cell states and are inherently influenced by technical noise, complicating the inference and representation of continuous transcriptional dynamics. Although embedding methods can reduce dimensionality and mitigate technical noise, the majority of existing approaches typically treat trajectory inference separately from embedding construction, often neglecting temporal structure. To address this challenge, here we introduce CellStream, a novel deep learning framework that jointly learns embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data by integrating an autoencoder with unbalanced dynamical optimal transport. Compared to existing methods, CellStream generates dynamics-informed embeddings that robustly capture temporal developmental processes while maintaining high consistency with the underlying data manifold. We demonstrate CellStream's effectiveness on both simulated datasets and real scRNA-seq data, including spatial transcriptomics. Our experiments indicate significant quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art methods in representing cellular trajectories with enhanced temporal coherence and reduced noise sensitivity. Overall, CellStream provides a new tool for learning and representing continuous streams from the noisy, static snapshots of single-cell gene expression.",human
"Task-oriented dialogue systems have garnered significant attention due to their conversational ability to accomplish goals, such as booking airline tickets for users. Traditionally, task-oriented dialogue systems are conceptualized as intelligent agents that interact with users using natural language and have access to customized back-end APIs. However, in real-world scenarios, the widespread presence of front-end Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and the absence of customized back-end APIs create a significant gap for traditional task-oriented dialogue systems in practical applications. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we collect MMWOZ, a new multimodal dialogue dataset that is extended from MultiWOZ 2.3 dataset. Specifically, we begin by developing a web-style GUI to serve as the front-end. Next, we devise an automated script to convert the dialogue states and system actions from the original dataset into operation instructions for the GUI. Lastly, we collect snapshots of the web pages along with their corresponding operation instructions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal model called MATE (Multimodal Agent for Task-oriEnted dialogue) as the baseline model for the MMWOZ dataset. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experimental analysis using MATE to investigate the construction of a practical multimodal agent for task-oriented dialogue.",human
"Static IR drop analysis is a fundamental and critical task in the field of chip design. Nevertheless, this process can be quite time-consuming, potentially requiring several hours. Moreover, addressing IR drop violations frequently demands iterative analysis, thereby causing the computational burden. Therefore, fast and accurate IR drop prediction is vital for reducing the overall time invested in chip design. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel multimodal approach that efficiently processes SPICE files through large-scale netlist transformer (LNT). Our key innovation is representing and processing netlist topology as 3D point cloud representations, enabling efficient handling of netlist with up to hundreds of thousands to millions nodes. All types of data, including netlist files and image data, are encoded into latent space as features and fed into the model for static voltage drop prediction. This enables the integration of data from multiple modalities for complementary predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve the best F1 score and the lowest MAE among the winning teams of the ICCAD 2023 contest and the state-of-the-art algorithms.",human
"Recent advances in pretrained language models (PLMs) have significantly improved conversational recommender systems (CRS), enabling more fluent and context-aware interactions. To further enhance accuracy and mitigate hallucination, many methods integrate PLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs), but face key challenges: failing to fully exploit PLM reasoning over graph relationships, indiscriminately incorporating retrieved knowledge without context filtering, and neglecting collaborative preferences in multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals. A semantic alignment module harmonizes heterogeneous inputs, reducing noise and enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCRS-TKA consistently outperforms all baselines in both recommendation and conversational quality.",human
"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is widely used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, RLHF-trained reward models often exhibit length bias -- a systematic tendency to favor longer responses by conflating verbosity with quality. We propose a causal framework for analyzing and mitigating length bias in RLHF reward modeling. Central to our approach is a counterfactual data augmentation method that generates response pairs designed to isolate content quality from verbosity. These counterfactual examples are then used to train the reward model, enabling it to assess responses based on content quality independently of verbosity. Specifically, we construct (1) length-divergent pairs with similar content and (2) content-divergent pairs of similar length. Empirical evaluations show that our method reduces length bias in reward assignment and leads to more concise, content-focused outputs from the policy model. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces length bias and improves the robustness and content sensitivity of reward modeling in RLHF pipelines.",human
"This research aims to optimize intricate learning models by implementing quantization and bit-depth optimization techniques. The objective is to significantly cut time complexity while preserving model efficiency, thus addressing the challenge of extended execution times in intricate models. Two medical datasets were utilized as case studies to apply a Logistic Regression (LR) machine learning model. Using efficient quantization and bit depth optimization strategies the input data is downscaled from float64 to float32 and int32. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in time complexity, with only a minimal decrease in model accuracy post-optimization, showcasing the state-of-the-art optimization approach. This comprehensive study concludes that the impact of these optimization techniques varies depending on a set of parameters.",human
"Existing linguistic steganography methods primarily rely on content transformations to conceal secret messages. However, they often cause subtle yet looking-innocent deviations between normal and stego texts, posing potential security risks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a content-preserving linguistic steganography paradigm for perfectly secure covert communication without modifying the cover text. Based on this paradigm, we introduce CLstega (\textit{C}ontent-preserving \textit{L}inguistic \textit{stega}nography), a novel method that embeds secret messages through controllable distribution transformation. CLstega first applies an augmented masking strategy to locate and mask embedding positions, where MLM(masked language model)-predicted probability distributions are easily adjustable for transformation. Subsequently, a dynamic distribution steganographic coding strategy is designed to encode secret messages by deriving target distributions from the original probability distributions. To achieve this transformation, CLstega elaborately selects target words for embedding positions as labels to construct a masked sentence dataset, which is used to fine-tune the original MLM, producing a target MLM capable of directly extracting secret messages from the cover text. This approach ensures perfect security of secret messages while fully preserving the integrity of the original cover text. Experimental results show that CLstega can achieve a 100\% extraction success rate, and outperforms existing methods in security, effectively balancing embedding capacity and security.",human
"We study the $k$-means problem for a set $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ segments, aiming to find $k$ centers $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that minimize   $D(\mathcal{S},X) := \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \min_{x \in X} D(S,x)$, where $D(S,x) := \int_{p \in S} |p - x| dp$   measures the total distance from each point along a segment to a center. Variants of this problem include handling outliers, employing alternative distance functions such as M-estimators, weighting distances to achieve balanced clustering, or enforcing unique cluster assignments. For any $\varepsilon > 0$, an $\varepsilon$-coreset is a weighted subset $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that approximates $D(\mathcal{S},X)$ within a factor of $1 \pm \varepsilon$ for any set of $k$ centers, enabling efficient streaming, distributed, or parallel computation. We propose the first coreset construction that provably handles arbitrary input segments. For constant $k$ and $\varepsilon$, it produces a coreset of size $O(\log^2 n)$ computable in $O(nd)$ time. Experiments, including a real-time video tracking application, demonstrate substantial speedups with minimal loss in clustering accuracy, confirming both the practical efficiency and theoretical guarantees of our method.",human
"Modeling the dynamics of financial Limit Order Books (LOB) at the message level is challenging due to irregular event timing, rapid regime shifts, and the reactions of high-frequency traders to visible order flow. Previous LOB models require cumbersome data representations and lack adaptability outside their original tasks, leading us to introduce LOBERT, a general-purpose encoder-only foundation model for LOB data suitable for downstream fine-tuning. LOBERT adapts the original BERT architecture for LOB data by using a novel tokenization scheme that treats complete multi-dimensional messages as single tokens while retaining continuous representations of price, volume, and time. With these methods, LOBERT achieves leading performance in tasks such as predicting mid-price movements and next messages, while reducing the required context length compared to previous methods.",human
"Classical analyses of gradient descent (GD) define a stability threshold based on the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian, often termed sharpness. When the learning rate lies below this threshold, training is stable and the loss decreases monotonically. Yet, modern deep networks often achieve their best performance beyond this regime.   We demonstrate that such instabilities induce an implicit bias in GD, driving parameters toward flatter regions of the loss landscape and thereby improving generalization. The key mechanism is the Rotational Polarity of Eigenvectors (RPE), a geometric phenomenon in which the leading eigenvectors of the Hessian rotate during training instabilities. These rotations, which increase with learning rates, promote exploration and provably lead to flatter minima.   This theoretical framework extends to stochastic GD, where instability-driven flattening persists and its empirical effects outweigh minibatch noise. Finally, we show that restoring instabilities in Adam further improves generalization.   Together, these results establish and understand the constructive role of training instabilities in deep learning.",human
"This paper pioneers the integration of learning optimization into measurement matrix design for phase retrieval. We introduce the Deep Learning-based Measurement Matrix for Phase Retrieval (DLMMPR) algorithm, which parameterizes the measurement matrix within an end-to-end deep learning architecture. Synergistically augmented with subgradient descent and proximal mapping modules for robust recovery, DLMMPR's efficacy is decisively confirmed through comprehensive empirical validation across diverse noise regimes. Benchmarked against DeepMMSE and PrComplex, our method yields substantial gains in PSNR and SSIM, underscoring its superiority.",human
"Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control.",human
"First-order optimizers are reliable but slow in sharp, anisotropic regions. We study a curvature-adaptive method that periodically sketches a low-rank Hessian subspace via Hessian--vector products and preconditions gradients only in that subspace, leaving the orthogonal complement first-order. For L-smooth non-convex objectives, we recover the standard O(1/T) stationarity guarantee with a widened stable stepsize range; under a Polyak--Lojasiewicz (PL) condition with bounded residual curvature outside the sketch, the loss contracts at refresh steps. On CIFAR-10/100 with ResNet-18/34, the method enters the low-loss region substantially earlier: measured by epochs to a pre-declared train-loss threshold (0.75), it reaches the threshold 2.95x faster than Adam on CIFAR-100/ResNet-18, while matching final test accuracy. The approach is one-knob: performance is insensitive to the sketch rank k across {1,3,5}, and k=0 yields a principled curvature-free ablation. We release anonymized logs and scripts that regenerate all figures and tables.",human
"Stochastic multi-objective optimization (SMOOP) requires ranking multivariate distributions; yet, most empirical studies perform scalarization, which loses information and is unreliable. Based on the optimal transport theory, we introduce the center-outward q-dominance relation and prove it implies strong first-order stochastic dominance (FSD). Also, we develop an empirical test procedure based on q-dominance, and derive an explicit sample size threshold, $n^*(δ)$, to control the Type I error. We verify the usefulness of our approach in two scenarios: (1) as a ranking method in hyperparameter tuning; (2) as a selection method in multi-objective optimization algorithms. For the former, we analyze the final stochastic Pareto sets of seven multi-objective hyperparameter tuners on the YAHPO-MO benchmark tasks with q-dominance, which allows us to compare these tuners when the expected hypervolume indicator (HVI, the most common performance metric) of the Pareto sets becomes indistinguishable. For the latter, we replace the mean value-based selection in the NSGA-II algorithm with $q$-dominance, which shows a superior convergence rate on noise-augmented ZDT benchmark problems. These results establish center-outward q-dominance as a principled, tractable foundation for seeking truly stochastically dominant solutions for SMOOPs.",human
"The growing demand for low-power and area-efficient TinyML inference on AIoT devices necessitates memory architectures that minimise data movement while sustaining high computational efficiency. This paper presents FERMI-ML, a Flexible and Resource-Efficient Memory-In-Situ (MIS) SRAM macro designed for TinyML acceleration. The proposed 9T XNOR-based RX9T bit-cell integrates a 5T storage cell with a 4T XNOR compute unit, enabling variable-precision MAC and CAM operations within the same array. A 22-transistor (C22T) compressor-tree-based accumulator facilitates logarithmic 1-64-bit MAC computation with reduced delay and power compared to conventional adder trees. The 4 KB macro achieves dual functionality for in-situ computation and CAM-based lookup operations, supporting Posit-4 or FP-4 precision. Post-layout results at 65 nm show operation at 350 MHz with 0.9 V, delivering a throughput of 1.93 TOPS and an energy efficiency of 364 TOPS/W, while maintaining a Quality-of-Result (QoR) above 97.5% with InceptionV4 and ResNet-18. FERMI-ML thus demonstrates a compact, reconfigurable, and energy-aware digital Memory-In-Situ macro capable of supporting mixed-precision TinyML workloads.",human
"We define the problem of linear Contextual Stochastic Shortest Path (CSSP), where at the beginning of each episode, the learner observes an adversarially chosen context that determines the MDP through a fixed but unknown linear function. The learner's objective is to reach a designated goal state with minimal expected cumulative loss, despite having no prior knowledge of the transition dynamics, loss functions, or the mapping from context to MDP. In this work, we propose LR-CSSP, an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(K^{2/3} d^{2/3} |S| |A|^{1/3} B_\star^2 T_\star \log (1/ δ))$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ is the context dimension, $S$ and $A$ are the sets of states and actions respectively, $B_\star$ bounds the optimal cumulative loss and $T_\star$, unknown to the learner, bounds the expected time for the optimal policy to reach the goal. In the case where all costs exceed $\ell_{\min}$, LR-CSSP attains a regret of $\widetilde O(\sqrt{K \cdot d^2 |S|^3 |A| B_\star^3 \log(1/δ)/\ell_{\min}})$. Unlike in contextual finite-horizon MDPs, where limited knowledge primarily leads to higher losses and regret, in the CSSP setting, insufficient knowledge can also prolong episodes and may even lead to non-terminating episodes. Our analysis reveals that LR-CSSP effectively handles continuous context spaces, while ensuring all episodes terminate within a reasonable number of time steps.",human
"Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit",human
"Large Language Models have seen expanding application across domains, yet their effectiveness as assistive tools for scientific writing -- an endeavor requiring precision, multimodal synthesis, and domain expertise -- remains insufficiently understood. We examine the potential of LLMs to support domain experts in scientific writing, with a focus on abstract composition. We design an incentivized randomized controlled trial with a hypothetical conference setup where participants with relevant expertise are split into an author and reviewer pool. Inspired by methods in behavioral science, our novel incentive structure encourages authors to edit the provided abstracts to an acceptable quality for a peer-reviewed submission. Our 2x2 between-subject design expands into two dimensions: the implicit source of the provided abstract and the disclosure of it. We find authors make most edits when editing human-written abstracts compared to AI-generated abstracts without source attribution, often guided by higher perceived readability in AI generation. Upon disclosure of source information, the volume of edits converges in both source treatments. Reviewer decisions remain unaffected by the source of the abstract, but bear a significant correlation with the number of edits made. Careful stylistic edits, especially in the case of AI-generated abstracts, in the presence of source information, improve the chance of acceptance. We find that AI-generated abstracts hold potential to reach comparable levels of acceptability to human-written ones with minimal revision, and that perceptions of AI authorship, rather than objective quality, drive much of the observed editing behavior. Our findings reverberate the significance of source disclosure in collaborative scientific writing.",human
"This paper investigates the impact of perturbations on the best-response-based algorithms approximating Nash equilibria in zero-sum games, namely Double Oracle and Fictitious Play. More precisely, we assume that the oracle computing the best responses perturbs the utilities before selecting the best response. We show that using such an oracle reduces the number of iterations for both algorithms. For some cases, suitable perturbations ensure the expected number of iterations is logarithmic. Although the utility perturbation is computationally demanding as it requires iterating through all pure strategies, we demonstrate that one can efficiently perturb the utilities in games where pure strategies have further inner structure.",human
"We reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024), which proposes adapting a language model at inference time by fine-tuning on retrieved nearest-neighbor sequences. Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Overall, our results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.",human
"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves large language models by retrieving external knowledge, often truncated into smaller chunks due to the input context window, which leads to information loss, resulting in response hallucinations and broken reasoning chains. Moreover, traditional RAG retrieves unstructured knowledge, introducing irrelevant details that hinder accurate reasoning. To address these issues, we propose TAdaRAG, a novel RAG framework for on-the-fly task-adaptive knowledge graph construction from external sources. Specifically, we design an intent-driven routing mechanism to a domain-specific extraction template, followed by supervised fine-tuning and a reinforcement learning-based implicit extraction mechanism, ensuring concise, coherent, and non-redundant knowledge integration. Evaluations on six public benchmarks and a real-world business benchmark (NowNewsQA) across three backbone models demonstrate that TAdaRAG outperforms existing methods across diverse domains and long-text tasks, highlighting its strong generalization and practical effectiveness.",human
"Physics-informed learning for PDEs is surging across scientific computing and industrial simulation, yet prevailing methods face spectral bias, residual-data imbalance, and weak extrapolation. We introduce a representation-level spectral remodeling xLSTM-PINN that combines gated-memory multiscale feature extraction with adaptive residual-data weighting to curb spectral bias and strengthen extrapolation. Across four benchmarks, we integrate gated cross-scale memory, a staged frequency curriculum, and adaptive residual reweighting, and verify with analytic references and extrapolation tests, achieving markedly lower spectral error and RMSE and a broader stable learning-rate window. Frequency-domain benchmarks show raised high-frequency kernel weights and a right-shifted resolvable bandwidth, shorter high-k error decay and time-to-threshold, and narrower error bands with lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE. Compared with the baseline PINN, we reduce MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE across all four benchmarks and deliver cleaner boundary transitions with attenuated high-frequency ripples in both frequency and field maps. This work suppresses spectral bias, widens the resolvable band and shortens the high-k time-to-threshold under the same budget, and without altering AD or physics losses improves accuracy, reproducibility, and transferability.",human
"With growing concerns over image authenticity and digital safety, the field of AI-generated image (AIGI) detection has progressed rapidly. Yet, most AIGI detectors still struggle under real-world degradations, particularly motion blur, which frequently occurs in handheld photography, fast motion, and compressed video. Such blur distorts fine textures and suppresses high-frequency artifacts, causing severe performance drops in real-world settings. We address this limitation with a blur-robust AIGI detection framework based on teacher-student knowledge distillation. A high-capacity teacher (DINOv3), trained on clean (i.e., sharp) images, provides stable and semantically rich representations that serve as a reference for learning. By freezing the teacher to maintain its generalization ability, we distill its feature and logit responses from sharp images to a student trained on blurred counterparts, enabling the student to produce consistent representations under motion degradation. Extensive experiments benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under both motion-blurred and clean conditions, demonstrating improved generalization and real-world applicability. Source codes will be released at: https://github.com/JiaLiangShen/Dino-Detect-for-blur-robust-AIGC-Detection.",human
"Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.",human
"Decomposing sentences into fine-grained meaning units is increasingly used to model semantic alignment. While QA-based semantic approaches have shown effectiveness for representing predicate-argument relations, they have so far left noun-centered semantics largely unaddressed. We introduce QA-Noun, a QA-based framework for capturing noun-centered semantic relations. QA-Noun defines nine question templates that cover both explicit syntactical and implicit contextual roles for nouns, producing interpretable QA pairs that complement verbal QA-SRL. We release detailed guidelines, a dataset of over 2,000 annotated noun mentions, and a trained model integrated with QA-SRL to yield a unified decomposition of sentence meaning into individual, highly fine-grained, facts. Evaluation shows that QA-Noun achieves near-complete coverage of AMR's noun arguments while surfacing additional contextually implied relations, and that combining QA-Noun with QA-SRL yields over 130\% higher granularity than recent fact-based decomposition methods such as FactScore and DecompScore. QA-Noun thus complements the broader QA-based semantic framework, forming a comprehensive and scalable approach to fine-grained semantic decomposition for cross-text alignment.",human
"Binary Spiking Neural Networks (BSNNs) offer promising efficiency advantages for resource-constrained computing. However, their training algorithms often require substantial memory overhead due to latent weights storage and temporal processing requirements. To address this issue, we propose Binary Spiking Online (BSO) optimization algorithm, a novel online training algorithm that significantly reduces training memory. BSO directly updates weights through flip signals under the online training framework. These signals are triggered when the product of gradient momentum and weights exceeds a threshold, eliminating the need for latent weights during training. To enhance performance, we propose T-BSO, a temporal-aware variant that leverages the inherent temporal dynamics of BSNNs by capturing gradient information across time steps for adaptive threshold adjustment. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for both BSO and T-BSO, with formal regret bounds characterizing their convergence rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both BSO and T-BSO achieve superior optimization performance compared to existing training methods for BSNNs. The codes are available at https://github.com/hamings1/BSO.",human
"Multi-GPU programming traditionally requires developers to navigate complex trade-offs between performance and programmability. High-performance implementations typically rely on low-level HIP/CUDA communication libraries that demand substantial engineering effort for even basic overlap patterns, while simpler abstractions often sacrifice performance. We present Iris, a multi-GPU communication library implemented entirely in Python and Triton that eliminates this trade-off. Iris provides tile-based symmetric memory abstractions that naturally align with Triton's programming model, enabling developers to write single-source kernels that seamlessly interleave computation and communication. We demonstrate a taxonomy of compute-communication overlap patterns--from bulk-synchronous to fine-grained workgroup specialization--that can be implemented with minimal code changes in Iris, often requiring just a few additional lines within the same Triton kernel. Our evaluation shows that Iris achieves near-optimal bandwidth utilization in microbenchmarks and delivers up to 1.79x speedup over PyTorch and RCCL for GEMM+All-Scatter workloads, demonstrating that high-level implementations can match or exceed heavily-optimized libraries while dramatically simplifying multi-GPU programming.",human
"We present SGuard-v1, a lightweight safety guardrail for Large Language Models (LLMs), which comprises two specialized models to detect harmful content and screen adversarial prompts in human-AI conversational settings. The first component, ContentFilter, is trained to identify safety risks in LLM prompts and responses in accordance with the MLCommons hazard taxonomy, a comprehensive framework for trust and safety assessment of AI. The second component, JailbreakFilter, is trained with a carefully designed curriculum over integrated datasets and findings from prior work on adversarial prompting, covering 60 major attack types while mitigating false-unsafe classification. SGuard-v1 is built on the 2B-parameter Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct model that supports 12 languages. We curate approximately 1.4 million training instances from both collected and synthesized data and perform instruction tuning on the base model, distributing the curated data across the two component according to their designated functions. Through extensive evaluation on public and proprietary safety benchmarks, SGuard-v1 achieves state-of-the-art safety performance while remaining lightweight, thereby reducing deployment overhead. SGuard-v1 also improves interpretability for downstream use by providing multi-class safety predictions and their binary confidence scores. We release the SGuard-v1 under the Apache-2.0 License to enable further research and practical deployment in AI safety.",human
"Label distribution learning (LDL) is a novel paradigm that describe the samples by label distribution of a sample. However, acquiring LDL dataset is costly and time-consuming, which leads to the birth of incomplete label distribution learning (IncomLDL). All the previous IncomLDL methods set the description degrees of ""missing"" labels in an instance to 0, but remains those of other labels unchanged. This setting is unrealistic because when certain labels are missing, the degrees of the remaining labels will increase accordingly. We fix this unrealistic setting in IncomLDL and raise a new problem: LDL with hidden labels (HidLDL), which aims to recover a complete label distribution from a real-world incomplete label distribution where certain labels in an instance are omitted during annotation. To solve this challenging problem, we discover the significance of proportional information of the observed labels and capture it by an innovative constraint to utilize it during the optimization process. We simultaneously use local feature similarity and the global low-rank structure to reveal the mysterious veil of hidden labels. Moreover, we theoretically give the recovery bound of our method, proving the feasibility of our method in learning from hidden labels. Extensive recovery and predictive experiments on various datasets prove the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art LDL and IncomLDL methods.",human
"Fully Test-Time Adaptation (FTTA) addresses domain shifts without access to source data and training protocols of the pre-trained models. Traditional strategies that align source and target feature distributions are infeasible in FTTA due to the absence of training data and unpredictable target domains. In this work, we exploit a dual perspective on FTTA, and propose Agnostic FTTA (AFTTA) as a novel formulation that enables the usage of off-the-shelf domain transformations during test-time to enable direct generalization to unforeseeable target data. To address this, we develop an uncover-and-unlearn approach. First, we uncover potential unwanted shifts between source and target domains by simulating them through predefined mappings and consider them as nuisances. Then, during test-time prediction, the model is enforced to unlearn these nuisances by regularizing the consequent shifts in latent representations and label predictions. Specifically, a mutual information-based criterion is devised and applied to guide nuisances unlearning in the feature space and encourage confident and consistent prediction in label space. Our proposed approach explicitly addresses agnostic domain shifts, enabling superior model generalization under FTTA constraints. Extensive experiments on various tasks, involving corruption and style shifts, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches.",human
"Structure-Based drug design (SBDD) has emerged as a popular approach in drug discovery, leveraging three-dimensional protein structures to generate drug ligands. However, existing generative models encounter several key challenges: (1) incorporating boundary condition constraints, (2) integrating hierarchical structural conditions, and (3) ensuring spatial modeling fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose SculptDrug, a spatial condition-aware generative model based on Bayesian flow networks (BFNs). First, SculptDrug follows a BFN-based framework and employs a progressive denoising strategy to ensure spatial modeling fidelity, iteratively refining atom positions while enhancing local interactions for precise spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a Boundary Awareness Block that incorporates protein surface constraints into the generative process to ensure that generated ligands are geometrically compatible with the target protein. Third, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that captures global structural context while preserving fine-grained molecular interactions, ensuring overall consistency and accurate ligand-protein conformations. We evaluate SculptDrug on the CrossDocked dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that SculptDrug outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of spatial condition-aware modeling.",human
"Large Language Models remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts that elicit toxic content even after safety alignment. We present ToxSearch, a black-box evolutionary framework that tests model safety by evolving prompts in a synchronous steady-state loop. The system employs a diverse set of operators, including lexical substitutions, negation, back-translation, paraphrasing, and two semantic crossover operators, while a moderation oracle provides fitness guidance. Operator-level analysis shows heterogeneous behavior: lexical substitutions offer the best yield-variance trade-off, semantic-similarity crossover acts as a precise low-throughput inserter, and global rewrites exhibit high variance with elevated refusal costs. Using elite prompts evolved on LLaMA 3.1 8B, we observe practically meaningful but attenuated cross-model transfer, with toxicity roughly halving on most targets, smaller LLaMA 3.2 variants showing the strongest resistance, and some cross-architecture models retaining higher toxicity. These results suggest that small, controllable perturbations are effective vehicles for systematic red-teaming and that defenses should anticipate cross-model reuse of adversarial prompts rather than focusing only on single-model hardening.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in scientific domains. While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation.",human
"With the integration of massive distributed energy resources and the widespread participation of novel market entities, the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs) is progressively evolving into a complex multi-scenario, multi-objective problem. Although expert engineers have developed numerous domain specific models (DSMs) to address distinct technical problems, mastering, integrating, and orchestrating these heterogeneous DSMs still entail considerable overhead for ADN operators. Therefore, an intelligent approach is urgently required to unify these DSMs and enable efficient coordination. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the ADN-Agent architecture, which leverages a general large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple DSMs, enabling adaptive intent recognition, task decomposition, and DSM invocation. Within the ADN-Agent, we design a novel communication mechanism that provides a unified and flexible interface for diverse heterogeneous DSMs. Finally, for some language-intensive subtasks, we propose an automated training pipeline for fine-tuning small language models, thereby effectively enhancing the overall problem-solving capability of the system. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method and demonstrate that the ADN-Agent architecture outperforms existing LLM application paradigms.",human
"Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, standard methods relying on active measurements may introduce additional errors. Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) circumvents this by utilizing engineered dissipation and drives in bosonic systems, but identifying practical encoding remains challenging due to stringent Knill-Laflamme conditions. In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning. The agent first identifies an encoded subspace surpassing the breakeven point through rapid exploration within a constrained evolutionary time-frame, then strategically fine-tunes its policy to sustain this performance advantage over extended temporal horizons. We find that the two-phase trained agent can discover the optimal set of codewords, i.e., the Fock states $\ket{4}$ and $\ket{7}$ considering the effect of both single-photon and double-photon loss. We identify that the discovered code surpasses the breakeven threshold over a longer evolution time and achieve the state-of-art performance. We also analyze the robustness of the code against the phase damping and amplitude damping noise. Our work highlights the potential of curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning in discovering the optimal quantum error correct code especially in early fault-tolerant quantum systems.",human
"In supervised learning, traditional image masking faces two key issues: (i) discarded pixels are underutilized, leading to a loss of valuable contextual information; (ii) masking may remove small or critical features, especially in fine-grained tasks. In contrast, masked image modeling (MIM) has demonstrated that masked regions can be reconstructed from partial input, revealing that even incomplete data can exhibit strong contextual consistency with the original image. This highlights the potential of masked regions as sources of semantic diversity. Motivated by this, we revisit the image masking approach, proposing to treat masked content as auxiliary knowledge rather than ignored. Based on this, we propose MaskAnyNet, which combines masking with a relearning mechanism to exploit both visible and masked information. It can be easily extended to any model with an additional branch to jointly learn from the recomposed masked region. This approach leverages the semantic diversity of the masked regions to enrich features and preserve fine-grained details. Experiments on CNN and Transformer backbones show consistent gains across multiple benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that the proposed method improves semantic diversity through the reuse of masked content.",human
"We present a novel framework for automated interior design that combines large language models (LLMs) with grid-based integer programming to jointly optimize room layout and furniture placement. Given a textual prompt, the LLM-driven agent workflow extracts structured design constraints related to room configurations and furniture arrangements. These constraints are encoded into a unified grid-based representation inspired by ``Modulor"". Our formulation accounts for key design requirements, including corridor connectivity, room accessibility, spatial exclusivity, and user-specified preferences. To improve computational efficiency, we adopt a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy that begins with a low-resolution grid to solve a simplified problem and guides the solution at the full resolution. Experimental results across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our joint optimization approach significantly outperforms existing two-stage design pipelines in solution quality, and achieves notable computational efficiency through the coarse-to-fine strategy.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), yet existing systems are typically optimized for returning highly relevant but predictable answers. A missing yet desired capacity is to exploit LLMs to suggest surprise and novel (""serendipitious"") answers. In this paper, we formally define the serendipity-aware KGQA task and propose the SerenQA framework to evaluate LLMs' ability to uncover unexpected insights in scientific KGQA tasks. SerenQA includes a rigorous serendipity metric based on relevance, novelty, and surprise, along with an expert-annotated benchmark derived from the Clinical Knowledge Graph, focused on drug repurposing. Additionally, it features a structured evaluation pipeline encompassing three subtasks: knowledge retrieval, subgraph reasoning, and serendipity exploration. Our experiments reveal that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on retrieval, they still struggle to identify genuinely surprising and valuable discoveries, underscoring a significant room for future improvements.

"Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated to be powerful priors for signal recovery, but their application to 1-bit quantization tasks, such as 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression, remains a challenge. This difficulty stems from the inherent non-linear link function in these tasks, which is either non-differentiable or lacks an explicit characterization. To tackle this issue, we introduce Diff-OneBit, which is a fast and effective DM-based approach for signal recovery under 1-bit quantization. Diff-OneBit addresses the challenge posed by non-differentiable or implicit links functions via leveraging a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization, thereby enabling gradient based iterations. This function is integrated into a flexible plug-and-play framework that decouples the data-fidelity term from the diffusion prior, allowing any pretrained DM to act as a denoiser within the iterative reconstruction process. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ, CelebA and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that Diff-OneBit gives high-fidelity reconstructed images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency across 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression tasks.",human
"This letter studies the problem of online multi-step-ahead prediction for unknown linear stochastic systems. Using conditional distribution theory, we derive an optimal parameterization of the prediction policy as a linear function of future inputs, past inputs, and past outputs. Based on this characterization, we propose an online least-squares algorithm to learn the policy and analyze its regret relative to the optimal model-based predictor. We show that the online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal Kalman filter in the multi-step setting. Furthermore, with new proof techniques, we establish an almost-sure regret bound that does not rely on fixed failure probabilities for sufficiently large horizons $N$. Finally, our analysis also reveals that, while the regret remains logarithmic in $N$, its constant factor grows polynomially with the prediction horizon $H$, with the polynomial order set by the largest Jordan block of eigenvalue 1 in the system matrix.",human
"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by integrating textual, acoustic, and visual signals. Although multimodal fusion is designed to leverage cross-modal complementarity, real-world scenarios often exhibit modality competition: dominant modalities tend to overshadow weaker ones, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose PaSE, a novel Prototype-aligned Calibration and Shapley-optimized Equilibrium framework, which enhances collaboration while explicitly mitigating modality competition. PaSE first applies Prototype-guided Calibration Learning (PCL) to refine unimodal representations and align them through an Entropic Optimal Transport mechanism that ensures semantic consistency. To further stabilize optimization, we introduce a Dual-Phase Optimization strategy. A prototype-gated fusion module is first used to extract shared representations, followed by Shapley-based Gradient Modulation (SGM), which adaptively adjusts gradients according to the contribution of each modality. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP, MOSI, and MOSEI confirm that PaSE achieves the superior performance and effectively alleviates modality competition.",human
"Previous methods evaluate reward models by testing them on a fixed pairwise ranking test set, but they typically do not provide performance information on each preference dimension. In this work, we address the evaluation challenge of reward models by probing preference representations. To confirm the effectiveness of this evaluation method, we construct a Multi-dimensional Reward Model Benchmark (MRMBench), a collection of six probing tasks for different preference dimensions. We design it to favor and encourage reward models that better capture preferences across different dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce an analysis method, inference-time probing, which identifies the dimensions used during the reward prediction and enhances its interpretability. Through extensive experiments, we find that MRMBench strongly correlates with the alignment performance of large language models (LLMs), making it a reliable reference for developing advanced reward models. Our analysis of MRMBench evaluation results reveals that reward models often struggle to capture preferences across multiple dimensions, highlighting the potential of multi-objective optimization in reward modeling. Additionally, our findings show that the proposed inference-time probing method offers a reliable metric for assessing the confidence of reward predictions, which ultimately improves the alignment of LLMs.",human
"Anomaly detection on attributed graphs plays an essential role in applications such as fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, and misinformation analysis. However, text-attributed graphs (TAGs), in which node information is expressed in natural language, remain underexplored, largely due to the absence of standardized benchmark datasets. In this work, we introduce TAG-AD, a comprehensive benchmark for anomaly node detection on TAGs. TAG-AD leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic anomalous node texts directly in the raw text space, producing anomalies that are semantically coherent yet contextually inconsistent and thus more reflective of real-world irregularities. In addition, TAG-AD incorporates multiple other anomaly types, enabling thorough and reproducible evaluation of graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods. With these datasets, we further benchmark existing unsupervised GNN-based GAD methods as well as zero-shot LLMs for GAD.   As part of our zero-shot detection setup, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-assisted, LLM-based zero-shot anomaly detection framework. The framework mitigates reliance on brittle, hand-crafted prompts by constructing a global anomaly knowledge base and distilling it into reusable analysis frameworks. Our experimental results reveal a clear division of strengths: LLMs are particularly effective at detecting contextual anomalies, whereas GNN-based methods remain superior for structural anomaly detection. Moreover, RAG-assisted prompting achieves performance comparable to human-designed prompts while eliminating manual prompt engineering, underscoring the practical value of our RAG-assisted zero-shot LLM anomaly detection framework.",human
"Multi-view multi-label data offers richer perspectives for artificial intelligence, but simultaneously presents significant challenges for feature selection due to the inherent complexity of interrelations among features, views and labels. Attention mechanisms provide an effective way for analyzing these intricate relationships. They can compute importance weights for information by aggregating correlations between Query and Key matrices to focus on pertinent values. However, existing attention-based feature selection methods predominantly focus on intra-view relationships, neglecting the complementarity of inter-view features and the critical feature-label correlations. Moreover, they often fail to account for feature redundancy, potentially leading to suboptimal feature subsets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method based on Redundancy-optimized Multi-head Attention Networks for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection (RMAN-MMFS). Specifically, we employ each individual attention head to model intra-view feature relationships and use the cross-attention mechanisms between different heads to capture inter-view feature complementarity. Furthermore, we design static and dynamic feature redundancy terms: the static term mitigates redundancy within each view, while the dynamic term explicitly models redundancy between unselected and selected features across the entire selection process, thereby promoting feature compactness. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets, compared against six multi-view multi-label feature selection methods, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.",human
"Depression represents a global mental health challenge requiring efficient and reliable automated detection methods. Current Transformer- or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based multimodal depression detection methods face significant challenges in modeling individual differences and cross-modal temporal dependencies across diverse behavioral contexts. Therefore, we propose P$^3$HF (Personality-guided Public-Private Domain Disentangled Hypergraph-Former Network) with three key innovations: (1) personality-guided representation learning using LLMs to transform discrete individual features into contextual descriptions for personalized encoding; (2) Hypergraph-Former architecture modeling high-order cross-modal temporal relationships; (3) event-level domain disentanglement with contrastive learning for improved generalization across behavioral contexts. Experiments on MPDD-Young dataset show P$^3$HF achieves around 10\% improvement on accuracy and weighted F1 for binary and ternary depression classification task over existing methods. Extensive ablation studies validate the independent contribution of each architectural component, confirming that personality-guided representation learning and high-order hypergraph reasoning are both essential for generating robust, individual-aware depression-related representations. The code is released at https://github.com/hacilab/P3HF.",human
"With the rapid adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse applications, there is a pressing need for task-centered, high-quality training data. A key limitation of current training datasets is their reliance on sparse annotations mined from the Internet or entered via manual typing that capture only a fraction of an image's visual content. Dense annotations are more valuable but remain scarce. Traditional text-based annotation pipelines are poorly suited for creating dense annotations: typing limits expressiveness, slows annotation speed, and underrepresents nuanced visual features, especially in specialized areas such as multicultural imagery and 3D asset annotation. In this paper, we present DenseAnnotate, an audio-driven online annotation platform that enables efficient creation of dense, fine-grained annotations for images and 3D assets. Annotators narrate observations aloud while synchronously linking spoken phrases to image regions or 3D scene parts. Our platform incorporates speech-to-text transcription and region-of-attention marking. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DenseAnnotate, we conducted case studies involving over 1,000 annotators across two domains: culturally diverse images and 3D scenes. We curate a human-annotated multi-modal dataset of 3,531 images, 898 3D scenes, and 7,460 3D objects, with audio-aligned dense annotations in 20 languages, including 8,746 image captions, 2,000 scene captions, and 19,000 object captions. Models trained on this dataset exhibit improvements of 5% in multilingual, 47% in cultural alignment, and 54% in 3D spatial capabilities. Our results show that our platform offers a feasible approach for future vision-language research and can be applied to various tasks and diverse types of data.",human
"X-ray scattering measurements of in situ human brain tissue encode structural signatures of pathological cross-$β$ inclusions, yet systematic exploitation of these data for automated detection remains challenging due to substrate contamination, strong inter-feature correlations, and limited sample sizes. This work develops a three-stage classification framework for identifying cross-$β$ structural inclusions-a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease-in X-ray scattering profiles of post-mortem human brain. Stage 1 employs a Bayes-optimal classifier to separate mica substrate from tissue regions on the basis of their distinct scattering signatures. Stage 2 introduces a multicollinearityaware, class-conditional correlation pruning scheme with formal guarantees on the induced Bayes risk and approximation error, thereby reducing redundancy while retaining class-discriminative information. Stage 3 trains a compact neural network on the pruned feature set to detect the presence or absence of cross-$β$ fibrillar ordering. The top-performing model, optimized with a composite loss combining Focal and Dice objectives, attains a test F1-score of 84.30% using 11 of 211 candidate features and 174 trainable parameters. The overall framework yields an interpretable, theory-grounded strategy for data-limited classification problems involving correlated, high-dimensional experimental measurements, exemplified here by X-ray scattering profiles of neurodegenerative tissue.",human
"The rapid growth of e-commerce calls for multimodal models that comprehend rich visual and textual product information. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for product understanding exhibit strong capability in representation learning for e-commerce, they still face three challenges: (i) the modality imbalance induced by modality mixed training; (ii) underutilization of the intrinsic alignment relationships among visual and textual information within a product; and (iii) limited handling of noise in e-commerce multimodal data. To address these, we propose MOON2.0, a dynamic modality-balanced multimodal representation learning framework for e-commerce product understanding. MOON2.0 comprises: (1) a Modality-driven Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module that adaptively processes input samples by their modality composition, enabling Multimodal Joint Learning to mitigate the modality imbalance; (2) a Dual-level Alignment method to better leverage semantic alignment properties inside individual products; and (3) an MLLM-based Image-text Co-augmentation strategy that integrates textual enrichment with visual expansion, coupled with Dynamic Sample Filtering to improve training data quality. We further introduce MBE2.0, a co-augmented multimodal representation benchmark for e-commerce representation learning and evaluation. Experiments show that MOON2.0 delivers state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MBE2.0 and multiple public datasets. Furthermore, attention-based heatmap visualization provides qualitative evidence of improved multimodal alignment of MOON2.0.",human
"We introduce SeedAIchemy, an automated LLM-driven corpus generation tool that makes it easier for developers to implement fuzzing effectively. SeedAIchemy consists of five modules which implement different approaches at collecting publicly available files from the internet. Four of the five modules use large language model (LLM) workflows to construct search terms designed to maximize corpus quality. Corpora generated by SeedAIchemy perform significantly better than a naive corpus and similarly to a manually-curated corpus on a diverse range of target programs and libraries.",human
"Dynamic graph learning plays a pivotal role in modeling evolving relationships over time, especially for temporal link prediction tasks in domains such as traffic systems, social networks, and recommendation platforms. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance by capturing long-range temporal dependencies, their reliance on self-attention results in quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, limiting scalability on high-frequency or large-scale graphs. In this work, we revisit the necessity of self-attention in dynamic graph modeling. Inspired by recent findings that attribute the success of Transformers more to their architectural design than attention itself, we propose GLFormer, a novel attention-free Transformer-style framework for dynamic graphs. GLFormer introduces an adaptive token mixer that performs context-aware local aggregation based on interaction order and time intervals. To capture long-term dependencies, we further design a hierarchical aggregation module that expands the temporal receptive field by stacking local token mixers across layers. Experiments on six widely-used dynamic graph benchmarks show that GLFormer achieves SOTA performance, which reveals that attention-free architectures can match or surpass Transformer baselines in dynamic graph settings with significantly improved efficiency.",human
"Online health resources and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as a first point of contact for medical decision-making, yet their reliability in healthcare remains limited by low accuracy, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to unverified information. We introduce a proof-of-concept conversational self-triage system that guides LLMs with 100 clinically validated flowcharts from the American Medical Association, providing a structured and auditable framework for patient decision support. The system leverages a multi-agent framework consisting of a retrieval agent, a decision agent, and a chat agent to identify the most relevant flowchart, interpret patient responses, and deliver personalized, patient-friendly recommendations, respectively. Performance was evaluated at scale using synthetic datasets of simulated conversations. The system achieved 95.29% top-3 accuracy in flowchart retrieval (N=2,000) and 99.10% accuracy in flowchart navigation across varied conversational styles and conditions (N=37,200). By combining the flexibility of free-text interaction with the rigor of standardized clinical protocols, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of transparent, accurate, and generalizable AI-assisted self-triage, with potential to support informed patient decision-making while improving healthcare resource utilization.",human
"This paper proposes a reinforcement learning--based framework for cryptocurrency portfolio management using the Soft Actor--Critic (SAC) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms. Traditional portfolio optimization methods often struggle to adapt to the highly volatile and nonlinear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. To address this, we design an agent that learns continuous trading actions directly from historical market data through interaction with a simulated trading environment. The agent optimizes portfolio weights to maximize cumulative returns while minimizing downside risk and transaction costs. Experimental evaluations on multiple cryptocurrencies demonstrate that the SAC and DDPG agents outperform baseline strategies such as equal-weighted and mean--variance portfolios. The SAC algorithm, with its entropy-regularized objective, shows greater stability and robustness in noisy market conditions compared to DDPG. These results highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning for adaptive and data-driven portfolio management in cryptocurrency markets.",human
"A long road trip is fun for drivers. However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness. Our proposed and implemented DCNNs embedded drowsiness detection model successfully react with NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset with drowsiness detection classification accuracy of 99.6% and 97% respectively.",human
"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown exceptional success in graph representation learning and a wide range of real-world applications. However, scaling deeper GNNs poses challenges due to the neighbor explosion problem when training on large-scale graphs. To mitigate this, a promising class of GNN training algorithms utilizes historical embeddings to reduce computation and memory costs while preserving the expressiveness of the model. These methods leverage historical embeddings for out-of-batch nodes, effectively approximating full-batch training without losing any neighbor information-a limitation found in traditional sampling methods. However, the staleness of these historical embeddings often introduces significant bias, acting as a bottleneck that can adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel VersatIle Staleness-Aware GNN, named VISAGNN, which dynamically and adaptively incorporates staleness criteria into the large-scale GNN training process. By embedding staleness into the message passing mechanism, loss function, and historical embeddings during training, our approach enables the model to adaptively mitigate the negative effects of stale embeddings, thereby reducing estimation errors and enhancing downstream accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in overcoming the staleness issue of existing historical embedding techniques, showcasing its superior performance and efficiency on large-scale benchmarks, along with significantly faster convergence.",human
"Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While RL has demonstrated substantial performance gains, it still faces key challenges, including low sampling efficiency and a strong dependence on model initialization: some models achieve rapid improvements with minimal RL steps, while others require significant training data to make progress. In this work, we investigate these challenges through the lens of reasoning token coverage and argue that initializing LLMs with diverse, high-quality reasoning primitives is essential for achieving stable and sample-efficient RL training. We propose Tailor, a finetuning pipeline that automatically discovers and curates novel reasoning primitives, thereby expanding the coverage of reasoning-state distributions before RL. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Tailor generates more diverse and higher-quality warm-start data, resulting in higher downstream RL performance.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances",human
"Text-attributed graphs (TAGs), which combine structural and textual node information, are ubiquitous across many domains. Recent work integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to jointly model semantics and structure, resulting in more general and expressive models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on TAG benchmarks. However, this integration introduces dual vulnerabilities: GNNs are sensitive to structural perturbations, while LLM-derived features are vulnerable to prompt injection and adversarial phrasing. While existing adversarial attacks largely perturb structure or text independently, we find that uni-modal attacks cause only modest degradation in LLM-enhanced GNNs. Moreover, many existing attacks assume unrealistic capabilities, such as white-box access or direct modification of graph data. To address these gaps, we propose GRAPHTEXTACK, the first black-box, multi-modal{, poisoning} node injection attack for LLM-enhanced GNNs. GRAPHTEXTACK injects nodes with carefully crafted structure and semantics to degrade model performance, operating under a realistic threat model without relying on model internals or surrogate models. To navigate the combinatorial, non-differentiable search space of connectivity and feature assignments, GRAPHTEXTACK introduces a novel evolutionary optimization framework with a multi-objective fitness function that balances local prediction disruption and global graph influence. Extensive experiments on five datasets and two state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced GNN models show that GRAPHTEXTACK significantly outperforms 12 strong baselines.",human
"ResNet has achieved tremendous success in computer vision through its residual connection mechanism. ResNet can be viewed as a discretized form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). From this perspective, the multiple residual blocks within a single ResNet stage essentially perform multi-step discrete iterations of the feature transformation for that stage. The recently proposed flow matching model, MeanFlow, enables one-step generative modeling by learning the mean velocity field to transform distributions. Inspired by this, we propose MeanFlow-Incubated ResNet (MFI-ResNet), which employs a compression-expansion strategy to jointly improve parameter efficiency and discriminative performance. In the compression phase, we simplify the multi-layer structure within each ResNet stage to one or two MeanFlow modules to construct a lightweight meta model. In the expansion phase, we apply a selective incubation strategy to the first three stages, expanding them to match the residual block configuration of the baseline ResNet model, while keeping the last stage in MeanFlow form, and fine-tune the incubated model. Experimental results show that on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, MFI-ResNet achieves remarkable parameter efficiency, reducing parameters by 46.28% and 45.59% compared to ResNet-50, while still improving accuracy by 0.23% and 0.17%, respectively. This demonstrates that generative flow-fields can effectively characterize the feature transformation process in ResNet, providing a new perspective for understanding the relationship between generative modeling and discriminative learning.",human
"This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.",human
"There is a large class of problems in algebraic combinatorics which can be distilled into the same challenge: construct an explicit combinatorial bijection. Traditionally, researchers have solved challenges like these by visually inspecting the data for patterns, formulating conjectures, and then proving them. But what is to be done if patterns fail to emerge until the data grows beyond human scale? In this paper, we propose a new workflow for discovering combinatorial bijections via machine learning. As a proof of concept, we train a transformer on paired Dyck paths and use its learned attention patterns to derive a new algorithmic description of the zeta map, which we call the \textit{Scaffolding Map}.",human
"Automated insulin delivery for Type 1 Diabetes must balance glucose control and safety under uncertain meals and physiological variability. While reinforcement learning (RL) enables adaptive personalization, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously guarantee safety, leaving a gap in achieving both personalized and risk-aware glucose control, such as overdosing before meals or stacking corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose TSODE, a safety-aware controller that integrates Thompson Sampling RL with a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NeuralODE) forecaster to address this challenge. Specifically, the NeuralODE predicts short-term glucose trajectories conditioned on proposed insulin doses, while a conformal calibration layer quantifies predictive uncertainty to reject or scale risky actions. In the FDA-approved UVa/Padova simulator (adult cohort), TSODE achieved 87.9% time-in-range with less than 10% time below 70 mg/dL, outperforming relevant baselines. These results demonstrate that integrating adaptive RL with calibrated NeuralODE forecasting enables interpretable, safe, and robust glucose regulation.",human
"Backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically couple a secret trigger to an explicit malicious output. We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response ""Sure"" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the ""Sure"" rate approaches 100\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors.",human
"Mobile devices increasingly require the parallel execution of several computing tasks offloaded at the wireless edge. Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\times$, 25$\times$, and 54$\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance. We pledge to publicly share the complete software codebase and the collected datasets for reproducibility.",human
"Model interpretability is crucial for establishing AI safety and clinician trust in medical applications for example, in survival modelling with competing risks. Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.",human
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made it possible for anyone to create images, audio, and video with unprecedented ease, enriching education, communication, and creative expression. At the same time, the rapid rise of AI-generated media has introduced serious risks, including misinformation, identity misuse, and the erosion of public trust as synthetic content becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real media. Although deepfake detection has advanced, many existing tools remain closed-source, limited in modality, or lacking transparency and educational value, making it difficult for users to understand how detection decisions are made. To address these gaps, we introduce SynthGuard, an open, user-friendly platform for detecting and analyzing AI-generated multimedia using both traditional detectors and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SynthGuard provides explainable inference, unified image and audio support, and an interactive interface designed to make forensic analysis accessible to researchers, educators, and the public.

"We introduce MSLoRA, a backbone-agnostic, parameter-efficient adapter that reweights feature responses rather   than re-tuning the underlying backbone. Existing low-rank adaptation methods are mostly confined to vision   transformers (ViTs) and struggle to generalize across architectures. MSLoRA unifies adaptation for both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and   ViTs by combining a low-rank linear projection with a multi-scale nonlinear transformation that jointly   modulates spatial and channel attention. The two components are fused through pointwise multiplication and   a residual connection, yielding a lightweight module that shifts feature attention while keeping pretrained   weights frozen.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSLoRA consistently improves transfer performance on classification,   detection, and segmentation tasks with roughly less than 5\% of backbone parameters.   The design further enables stable optimization, fast convergence, and strong cross-architecture   generalization. By reweighting rather than re-tuning, MSLoRA provides a simple and universal approach   for efficient adaptation of frozen vision backbones.",human
"Deep neural networks have been widely used as universal approximators for functions with inherent physical structures, including permutation symmetry. In this paper, we construct symmetric deep neural networks to approximate symmetric Korobov functions and prove that both the convergence rate and the constant prefactor scale at most polynomially with respect to the ambient dimension. This represents a substantial improvement over prior approximation guarantees that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Building on these approximation bounds, we further derive a generalization-error rate for learning symmetric Korobov functions whose leading factors likewise avoid the curse of dimensionality.",human

We evaluate our model's performance using real-world data from a large electronic marketplace, demonstrating its effectiveness in a practical forecasting scenario.",human
"Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.",human
"In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.",human
"We propose a new representation learning solution for the classification of cognitive load based on Electroencephalogram (EEG). Our method integrates both time and frequency domains by first passing the raw EEG signals through the convolutional encoder to obtain the time domain representations. Next, we measure the Power Spectral Density (PSD) for all five EEG frequency bands and generate the channel power values as 2D images referred to as multi-spectral topography maps. These multi-spectral topography maps are then fed to a separate encoder to obtain the representations in frequency domain. Our solution employs a multi-domain attention module that maps these domain-specific embeddings onto a shared embedding space to emphasize more on important inter-domain relationships to enhance the representations for cognitive load classification. Additionally, we incorporate an orthogonal projection constraint during the training of our method to effectively increase the inter-class distances while improving intra-class clustering. This enhancement allows efficient discrimination between different cognitive states and aids in better grouping of similar states within the feature space. We validate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on two public EEG datasets, CL-Drive and CLARE for cognitive load classification. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our multi-domain approach over the traditional single-domain techniques. Moreover, we conduct ablation and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of various components of our method. Finally, robustness experiments on different amounts of added noise demonstrate the stability of our method compared to other state-of-the-art solutions.",human
"Supervised anomaly detection methods perform well in identifying known anomalies that are well represented in the training set. However, they often struggle to generalise beyond the training distribution due to decision boundaries that lack a clear definition of normality. Existing approaches typically address this by regularising the representation space during training, leading to separate optimisation in latent and label spaces. The learned normality is therefore not directly utilised at inference, and their anomaly scores often fall within arbitrary ranges that require explicit mapping or calibration for probabilistic interpretation. To achieve unified learning of geometric normality and label discrimination, we propose Centre-Enhanced Discriminative Learning (CEDL), a novel supervised anomaly detection framework that embeds geometric normality directly into the discriminative objective. CEDL reparameterises the conventional sigmoid-derived prediction logit through a centre-based radial distance function, unifying geometric and discriminative learning in a single end-to-end formulation. This design enables interpretable, geometry-aware anomaly scoring without post-hoc thresholding or reference calibration. Extensive experiments on tabular, time-series, and image data demonstrate that CEDL achieves competitive and balanced performance across diverse real-world anomaly detection tasks, validating its effectiveness and broad applicability.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong generalization across tasks in high-resource languages; however, their linguistic competence in low-resource and morphologically rich languages such as Tamil remains largely unexplored. Existing multilingual benchmarks often rely on translated English datasets, failing to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of the target language. To address this gap, we introduce ILAKKANAM, the first Tamil-specific linguistic evaluation benchmark manually curated using 820 questions from Sri Lankan school-level Tamil subject examination papers. Each question is annotated by trained linguists under five linguistic categories and a factual knowledge category, spanning Grades 1--13 to ensure broad linguistic coverage. We evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs using a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that Gemini 2.5 achieves the highest overall performance, while open-source models lag behind, highlighting the gap in linguistic grounding. Category- and grade-wise analyses reveal that all models perform well on lower-grade questions but show a clear decline as linguistic complexity increases. Further, no strong correlation is observed between a model's overall performance and its ability to identify linguistic categories, suggesting that performance may be driven by exposure rather than genuine understanding.",human
"Medical image analysis for complex tasks such as severity grading and disease subtype classification poses significant challenges due to intricate and similar visual patterns among classes, scarcity of labeled data, and variability in expert interpretations. Despite the usefulness of existing attention-based models in capturing complex visual patterns for medical image classification, underlying architectures often face challenges in effectively distinguishing subtle classes since they struggle to capture inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, resulting in incorrect diagnosis. To address this, we propose AGGRNet framework to extract informative and non-informative features to effectively understand fine-grained visual patterns and improve classification for complex medical image analysis tasks. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various medical imaging datasets, with the best improvement up to 5% over SOTA models on the Kvasir dataset.",human
"Negation instructions such as 'do not mention $X$' can paradoxically increase the accessibility of $X$ in human thought, a phenomenon known as ironic rebound. Large language models (LLMs) face the same challenge: suppressing a concept requires internally activating it, which may prime rebound instead of avoidance. We investigated this tension with two experiments. \textbf{(1) Load \& content}: after a negation instruction, we vary distractor text (semantic, syntactic, repetition) and measure rebound strength. \textbf{(2) Polarity separation}: We test whether models distinguish neutral from negative framings of the same concept and whether this separation predicts rebound persistence. Results show that rebound consistently arises immediately after negation and intensifies with longer or semantic distractors, while repetition supports suppression. Stronger polarity separation correlates with more persistent rebound. Together, these findings, complemented by a circuit tracing analysis that identifies sparse middle-layer attention heads amplifying forbidden tokens while early layers suppress, link cognitive predictions of ironic rebound with mechanistic insights into long-context interference. To support future work, we release ReboundBench, a dataset of $5,000$ systematically varied negation prompts designed to probe rebound in LLMs.",human
"Quantum optimization allows for up to exponential quantum speedups for specific, possibly industrially relevant problems. As the key algorithm in this field, we motivate and discuss the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which can be understood as a slightly generalized version of Quantum Annealing for gate-based quantum computers. We delve into the quantum circuit implementation of the QAOA, including Hamiltonian simulation techniques for higher-order Ising models, and discuss parameter training using the parameter shift rule. An example implementation with Pennylane source code demonstrates practical application for the Maximum Cut problem. Further, we show how constraints can be incorporated into the QAOA using Grover mixers, allowing to restrict the search space to strictly valid solutions for specific problems. Finally, we outline the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) as a generalization of the QAOA, highlighting its potential in the NISQ era and addressing challenges such as barren plateaus and ansatz design.",human
"Flow Matching has limited ability in achieving one-step generation due to its reliance on learned curved trajectories. Previous studies have attempted to address this limitation by either modifying the coupling distribution to prevent interpolant intersections or introducing consistency and mean-velocity modeling to promote straight trajectory learning. However, these approaches often suffer from discrete approximation errors, training instability, and convergence difficulties. To tackle these issues, in the present work, we propose \textbf{S}traight \textbf{V}ariational \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching (\textbf{S-VFM}), which integrates a variational latent code representing the ``generation overview'' into the Flow Matching framework. \textbf{S-VFM} explicitly enforces trajectory straightness, ideally producing linear generation paths. The proposed method achieves competitive performance across three challenge benchmarks and demonstrates advantages in both training and inference efficiency compared with existing methods.",human
"Autonomous agents operating in sequential decision-making tasks under uncertainty can benefit from external action suggestions, which provide valuable guidance but inherently vary in reliability. Existing methods for incorporating such advice typically assume static and known suggester quality parameters, limiting practical deployment. We introduce a framework that dynamically learns and adapts to varying suggester reliability in partially observable environments. First, we integrate suggester quality directly into the agent's belief representation, enabling agents to infer and adjust their reliance on suggestions through Bayesian inference over suggester types. Second, we introduce an explicit ``ask'' action allowing agents to strategically request suggestions at critical moments, balancing informational gains against acquisition costs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust performance across varying suggester qualities, adaptation to changing reliability, and strategic management of suggestion requests. This work provides a foundation for adaptive human-agent collaboration by addressing suggestion uncertainty in uncertain environments.",human
"As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient checkpoint saving\&loading has become crucial for managing storage, memory usage, and fault tolerance in LLM training. The current works do not comprehensively take into account the optimization of these several aspects. This paper proposes a novel checkpoint sparsification and quantization method that adapts dynamically to different training stages and model architectures. We present a comprehensive analysis of existing lossy and lossless compression techniques, identify current limitations, and introduce our adaptive approach that balances compression ratio, speed, and precision impact throughout the training process. Experiments on different sizes of LLMs demonstrate that our bitmask-based sparsification method achieves 16x compression ratio without compromising model accuracy. Additionally, the cluster-based quantization method achieves 2x compression ratio with little precision loss.",human
"Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations.",human
"Detecting anomalies in multivariate time series is essential for monitoring complex industrial systems, where high dimensionality, limited labeled data, and subtle dependencies between sensors cause significant challenges. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), an LSTM-based Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamic reward shaping, and an active learning module to address these issues in a unified learning framework. The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and selective supervision for accurate and scalable anomaly detection in real-world multivariate systems.",human
"We introduce VoiceCraft-X, an autoregressive neural codec language model which unifies multilingual speech editing and zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis across 11 languages: English, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, and Polish. VoiceCraft-X utilizes the Qwen3 large language model for phoneme-free cross-lingual text processing and a novel token reordering mechanism with time-aligned text and speech tokens to handle both tasks as a single sequence generation problem. The model generates high-quality, natural-sounding speech, seamlessly creating new audio or editing existing recordings within one framework. VoiceCraft-X shows robust performance in diverse linguistic settings, even with limited per-language data, underscoring the power of unified autoregressive approaches for advancing complex, real-world multilingual speech applications.

"Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces critical challenges, including high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited training samples with severe class imbalance. While CNNs excel at local feature extraction and transformers capture long-range dependencies, their isolated application yields suboptimal results due to quadratic complexity and insufficient inductive biases. We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck. The model employs a multi-scale convolutional stem with deep residual blocks and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module for hierarchical spatial features, followed by spectral encoder layers combining bidirectional RNNs (LSTM/GRU) with Multi-Scale Spectral Latent Attention (MSLA). MSLA reduces complexity from $\mathcal{O}(T^2D)$ to $\mathcal{O}(T\log(T)D)$ by adaptive latent token allocation (8-64 tokens) that scales logarithmically with the sequence length. Hierarchical cross-attention fusion dynamically aggregates multi-level representations for robust classification. Experiments conducted on the Indian Pines and Salinas datasets show state-of-the-art performance, achieving overall accuracies of 99.71% and 99.96%, significantly surpassing HybridSN, SSRN, and SpectralFormer. The learned embeddings exhibit superior inter-class separability and compact intra-class clustering, validating CLAReSNet's effectiveness under limited samples and severe class imbalance.",human
"Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly improved the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite these successes, existing methods mainly focus on single-domain RL (e.g., mathematics) with verifiable rewards (RLVR), and their reliance on purely online RL frameworks restricts the exploration space, thereby limiting reasoning performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by leveraging rubrics to provide both fine-grained reward signals and offline guidance. We propose $\textbf{RGR-GRPO}$ (Reward and Guidance through Rubrics), a rubric-driven RL framework for multi-domain reasoning. RGR-GRPO enables LLMs to receive dense and informative rewards while exploring a larger solution space during GRPO training. Extensive experiments across 14 benchmarks spanning multiple domains demonstrate that RGR-GRPO consistently outperforms RL methods that rely solely on alternative reward schemes or offline guidance. Compared with verifiable online RL baseline, RGR-GRPO achieves average improvements of +7.0%, +5.4%, +8.4%, and +6.6% on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and general reasoning tasks, respectively. Notably, RGR-GRPO maintains stable entropy fluctuations during off-policy training and achieves superior pass@k performance, reflecting sustained exploration and effective breakthrough beyond existing performance bottlenecks.",human
"Accurate turning movement counts at intersections are important for signal control, traffic management and urban planning. Computer vision systems for automatic turning movement counts typically rely on visual analysis in the image plane of an infrastructure camera. Here we explore potential advantages of back-projecting vehicles detected in one or more infrastructure cameras to the ground plane for analysis in real-world 3D coordinates. For single-camera systems we find that back-projection yields more accurate trajectory classification and turning movement counts. We further show that even higher accuracy can be achieved through weak fusion of back-projected detections from multiple cameras. These results suggeest that traffic should be analyzed on the ground plane, not the image plane",human
"Efficient deployment of machine learning models ultimately requires taking hardware constraints into account. The binary logic gate is the fundamental building block of all digital chips. Designing models that operate directly on these units enables energy-efficient computation. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of training randomly connected networks of binary logic gates (such as OR and NAND) using gradient-based methods. We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates. Moreover, for our largest architecture with 256,000 gates, LILogicNet achieves 60.98% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 exceeding the performance of prior logic-gate-based models with a comparable gate budget. At inference time, the fully binarized model operates with minimal compute overhead, making it exceptionally efficient and well suited for deployment on low-power digital hardware.",human
"Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate economic and organisational processes, from automated customer support and recruitment to investment advice and policy analysis. These systems are often assumed to embody rational decision making free from human error; yet they are trained on human language corpora that may embed cognitive and social biases. This study investigates whether advanced LLMs behave as rational agents or whether they reproduce human behavioural tendencies when faced with classic decision problems. Using two canonical experiments in behavioural economics, the ultimatum game and a gambling game, we elicit decisions from two state of the art models, Google Gemma7B and Qwen, under neutral and gender conditioned prompts. We estimate parameters of inequity aversion and loss-aversion and compare them with human benchmarks. The models display attenuated but persistent deviations from rationality, including moderate fairness concerns, mild loss aversion, and subtle gender conditioned differences.",human
"We study an inverse problem for stochastic and quantum dynamical systems in a time-label-free setting, where only unordered density snapshots sampled at unknown times drawn from an observation-time distribution are available. These observations induce a distribution over state densities, from which we seek to recover the parameters of the underlying evolution operator. We formulate this as learning a distribution-to-function neural operator and propose BlinDNO, a permutation-invariant architecture that integrates a multiscale U-Net encoder with an attention-based mixer. Numerical experiments on a wide range of stochastic and quantum systems, including a 3D protein-folding mechanism reconstruction problem in a cryo-EM setting, demonstrate that BlinDNO reliably recovers governing parameters and consistently outperforms existing neural inverse operator baselines.",human
"Automata learning has many applications in artificial intelligence and software engineering. Central to these applications is the $L^*$ algorithm, introduced by Angluin. The $L^*$ algorithm learns deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) in polynomial time when provided with a minimally adequate teacher. Unfortunately, the $L^*$ algorithm can only learn DFAs over finite alphabets, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we extend $L^*$ to learn symbolic automata whose transitions use predicates over rational numbers, i.e., over infinite and dense alphabets. Our result makes the $L^*$ algorithm applicable to new settings like (real) RGX, and time series. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it asks a number of queries to the teacher that is at most linear with respect to the number of transitions, and to the representation size of the predicates.",human
"Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, DoRA, and HiRA, enable lightweight adaptation of large pre-trained models via low-rank updates. However, existing PEFT approaches apply static, input-agnostic updates to all tokens, disregarding the varying importance and difficulty of different inputs. This uniform treatment can lead to overfitting on trivial content or under-adaptation on more informative regions, especially in autoregressive settings with distinct prefill and decoding dynamics. In this paper, we propose GateRA, a unified framework that introduces token-aware modulation to dynamically adjust the strength of PEFT updates. By incorporating adaptive gating into standard PEFT branches, GateRA enables selective, token-level adaptation, preserving pre-trained knowledge for well-modeled inputs while focusing capacity on challenging cases. Empirical visualizations reveal phase-sensitive behaviors, where GateRA automatically suppresses updates for redundant prefill tokens while emphasizing adaptation during decoding. To promote confident and efficient modulation, we further introduce an entropy-based regularization that encourages near-binary gating decisions. This regularization prevents diffuse update patterns and leads to interpretable, sparse adaptation without hard thresholding. Finally, we present a theoretical analysis showing that GateRA induces a soft gradient-masking effect over the PEFT path, enabling continuous and differentiable control over adaptation. Experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that GateRA consistently outperforms or matches prior PEFT methods.",human
"Self-consistency (SC) is a widely used test-time inference technique for improving performance in chain-of-thought reasoning. It involves generating multiple responses, or samples from a large language model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent answer. This procedure can naturally be viewed as a majority vote or empirical mode estimation. Despite its effectiveness, SC is prohibitively expensive at scale when naively applied to datasets, and it lacks a unified theoretical treatment of sample efficiency and scaling behavior. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of SC's scaling behavior and its variants, drawing on mode estimation and voting theory. We derive and empirically validate power law scaling for self-consistency across datasets, and analyze the sample efficiency for fixed-allocation and dynamic-allocation sampling schemes. From these insights, we introduce Blend-ASC, a novel variant of self-consistency that dynamically allocates samples to questions during inference, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency. Our approach uses 6.8x fewer samples than vanilla SC on average, outperforming both fixed- and dynamic-allocation SC baselines, thereby demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of efficiency. In contrast to existing variants, Blend-ASC is hyperparameter-free and can fit an arbitrary sample budget, ensuring it can be easily applied to any self-consistency application.",human
"As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly undertake digital work, reliable frameworks are needed to evaluate their real-world competence, adaptability, and capacity for human collaboration. Existing benchmarks remain largely static, synthetic, or domain-limited, providing limited insight into how agents perform in dynamic, economically meaningful environments. We introduce UpBench, a dynamically evolving benchmark grounded in real jobs drawn from the global Upwork labor marketplace. Each task corresponds to a verified client transaction, anchoring evaluation in genuine work activity and financial outcomes. UpBench employs a rubric-based evaluation framework, in which expert freelancers decompose each job into detailed, verifiable acceptance criteria and assess AI submissions with per-criterion feedback. This structure enables fine-grained analysis of model strengths, weaknesses, and instruction-following fidelity beyond binary pass/fail metrics. Human expertise is integrated throughout the data pipeline (from job curation and rubric construction to evaluation) ensuring fidelity to real professional standards and supporting research on human-AI collaboration. By regularly refreshing tasks to reflect the evolving nature of online work, UpBench provides a scalable, human-centered foundation for evaluating agentic systems in authentic labor-market contexts, offering a path toward a collaborative framework, where AI amplifies human capability through partnership rather than replacement.",human
"Large AI models have been widely adopted in wireless communications for channel modeling, beamforming, and resource optimization. However, most existing efforts remain limited to single-modality inputs and channel-specific objec- tives, overlooking the broader potential of large foundation models for unified wireless sensing. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSense, a multi-modal, multi-task foundation model that jointly addresses channel-centric, environment-aware, and human-centered sensing. Our framework integrates image, radar, LiDAR, and textual data by transforming them into vision- compatible representations, enabling effective cross-modal align- ment within a unified feature space. A modality gating mecha- nism adaptively fuses these representations, while a vision-based large language model backbone enables unified feature align- ment and instruction-driven task adaptation. Furthermore, task- specific sequential attention and uncertainty-based loss weighting mechanisms enhance cross-task generalization. Experiments on real wireless scenario datasets show that our approach outper- forms both task-specific and large-model baselines, confirming its strong generalization across heterogeneous sensing tasks.",human
"Developing Medical AI relies on large datasets and easily suffers from data scarcity. Generative data augmentation (GDA) using AI generative models offers a solution to synthesize realistic medical images. However, the bias in GDA is often underestimated in medical domains, with concerns about the risk of introducing detrimental features generated by AI and harming downstream tasks. This paper identifies the frequency misalignment between real and synthesized images as one of the key factors underlying unreliable GDA and proposes the Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method to reduce the frequency distributional discrepancy and thus improve GDA. FreRec involves (1) Statistical High-frequency Replacement (SHR) to roughly align high-frequency components and (2) Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) to enhance image quality and reconstruct high-frequency details. Extensive experiments were conducted in various medical datasets, including brain MRIs, chest X-rays, and fundus images. The results show that FreRec significantly improves downstream medical image classification performance compared to uncalibrated AI-synthesized samples. FreRec is a standalone post-processing step that is compatible with any generative model and can integrate seamlessly with common medical GDA pipelines.",human
"LLMs have achieved performance that surpasses humans in many NLP tasks. However, it remains unclear whether problems that are difficult for humans are also difficult for LLMs. This study investigates how the difficulty of quizzes in a buzzer setting differs between LLMs and humans. Specifically, we first collect Japanese quiz data including questions, answers, and correct response rate of humans, then prompted LLMs to answer the quizzes under several settings, and compare their correct answer rate to that of humans from two analytical perspectives. The experimental results showed that, compared to humans, LLMs struggle more with quizzes whose correct answers are not covered by Wikipedia entries, and also have difficulty with questions that require numerical answers.",human
"Summarization of legal judgments poses a heavy cognitive burden on law practitioners due to the complexity of the language, context-sensitive legal jargon, and the length of the document. Therefore, the automatic summarization of legal documents has attracted serious attention from natural language processing researchers. Since the abstractive summaries of legal documents generated by deep neural methods remain prone to the risk of misrepresenting nuanced legal jargon or overlooking key contextual details, we envisage a rising trend toward the use of extractive case summarizers.   Given the high cost of human annotation for gold standard extractive summaries, we engineer a light and transparent pipeline that leverages existing abstractive gold standard summaries to create the corresponding extractive gold standard versions. The approach ensures that the experts` opinions ensconced in the original gold standard abstractive summaries are carried over to the transformed extractive summaries. We aim to augment seven existing case summarization datasets, which include abstractive summaries, by incorporating corresponding extractive summaries and create an enriched data resource for case summarization research community. To ensure the quality of the augmented extractive summaries, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation with the original abstractive gold standard summaries covering structural, lexical, and semantic dimensions. We also compare the domain-level information of the two summaries. We commit to release the augmented datasets in the public domain for use by the research community and believe that the resource will offer opportunities to advance the field of automatic summarization of legal documents.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly data-intensive due to growing model sizes, and they are becoming memory-bound as the context length and, consequently, the key-value (KV) cache size increase. Inference, particularly the decoding phase, is dominated by memory-bound GEMV or flat GEMM operations with low operational intensity (OI), making it well-suited for processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches. However, existing in/near-memory solutions face critical limitations such as reduced memory capacity due to the high area cost of integrating processing elements (PEs) within DRAM chips, and limited PE capability due to the constraints of DRAM fabrication technology. This work presents a chiplet-based memory module that addresses these limitations by decoupling logic and memory into chiplets fabricated in heterogeneous technology nodes and connected via an interposer. The logic chiplets sustain high bandwidth access to the DRAM chiplets, which house the memory banks, and enable the integration of advanced processing components such as systolic arrays and SRAM-based buffers to accelerate memory-bound GEMM kernels, capabilities that were not feasible in prior PIM architectures. We propose Sangam, a CXL-attached PIM-chiplet based memory module that can either act as a drop-in replacement for GPUs or co-executes along side the GPUs. Sangam achieves speedup of 3.93, 4.22, 2.82x speedup in end-to-end query latency, 10.3, 9.5, 6.36x greater decoding throughput, and order of magnitude energy savings compared to an H100 GPU for varying input size, output length, and batch size on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA 3-70B, respectively.",human
"Lexical tone is central to many languages but remains underexplored in self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models, especially beyond Mandarin. We study four languages with complex and diverse tone systems: Burmese, Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese, to examine how far such models listen for tone and how transfer operates in low-resource conditions. As a baseline reference, we estimate the temporal span of tone cues to be about 100 ms in Burmese and Thai, and about 180 ms in Lao and Vietnamese. Probes and gradient analyses on fine-tuned SSL models reveal that tone transfer varies by downstream task: automatic speech recognition fine-tuning aligns spans with language-specific tone cues, while prosody- and voice-related tasks bias the model toward overly long spans. These findings indicate that tone transfer is shaped by downstream task, highlighting task effects on temporal focus in tone modeling.",human
"Motivated by the high costs of using black-box Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a novel prompt compression paradigm, under which we use smaller LLMs to compress inputs for the larger ones. We present the first comprehensive LLM-as-a-compressor benchmark spanning 25 open- and closed-source models, which reveals significant disparity in models' compression ability in terms of (i) preserving semantically important information (ii) following the user-provided compression rate (CR). We further improve the performance of gpt-4.1-mini, the best overall vanilla compressor, with Textgrad-based compression meta-prompt optimization. We also identify the most promising open-source vanilla LLM - Qwen3-4B - and post-train it with a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), pursuing the dual objective of CR adherence and maximizing the downstream task performance. We call the resulting model Cmprsr and demonstrate its superiority over both extractive and vanilla abstractive compression across the entire range of compression rates on lengthy inputs from MeetingBank and LongBench as well as short prompts from GSM8k. The latter highlights Cmprsr's generalizability across varying input lengths and domains. Moreover, Cmprsr closely follows the requested compression rate, offering fine control over the cost-quality trade-off.",human
"Diffusion-based multimodal large language models (Diffusion MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive non-autoregressive generative capabilities across vision-and-language tasks. However, Diffusion MLLMs exhibit substantially slower inference than autoregressive models: Each denoising step employs full bidirectional self-attention over the entire sequence, resulting in cubic decoding complexity that becomes computationally impractical with thousands of visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens. Then it maintains a proportion of the most salient tokens and merges the remainder through similarity-based aggregation. This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance. The code is released at https://github.com/bcmi/D3ToM-Diffusion-MLLM.",human
"High-dimensional data often contain low-dimensional signals obscured by structured background noise, which limits the effectiveness of standard PCA. Motivated by contrastive learning, we address the problem of recovering shared signal subspaces from positive pairs, paired observations sharing the same signal but differing in background. Our baseline, PCA+, uses alignment-only contrastive learning and succeeds when background variation is mild, but fails under strong noise or high-dimensional regimes. To address this, we introduce PCA++, a hard uniformity-constrained contrastive PCA that enforces identity covariance on projected features. PCA++ has a closed-form solution via a generalized eigenproblem, remains stable in high dimensions, and provably regularizes against background interference. We provide exact high-dimensional asymptotics in both fixed-aspect-ratio and growing-spike regimes, showing uniformity's role in robust signal recovery. Empirically, PCA++ outperforms standard PCA and alignment-only PCA+ on simulations, corrupted-MNIST, and single-cell transcriptomics, reliably recovering condition-invariant structure. More broadly, we clarify uniformity's role in contrastive learning, showing that explicit feature dispersion defends against structured noise and enhances robustness.",human
"Modeling the cognitive and experiential factors of human navigation is central to deepening our understanding of human-environment interaction and to enabling safe social navigation and effective assistive wayfinding. Most existing methods focus on forecasting motions in fully observed scenes and often neglect human factors that capture how people feel and respond to space.

To facilitate research in the field, we introduce the Cognition-aware Egocentric Navigation (CEN) dataset consisting 6 hours of real-world egocentric recordings capturing diverse navigation behaviors in real-world scenarios. Experiments show that EgoCogNav learns the perceived uncertainty that highly correlates with human-like behaviors such as scanning, hesitation, and backtracking while generalizing to unseen environments.",human
"Large language models are increasingly influencing human moral decisions, yet current approaches focus primarily on evaluating rather than actively steering their moral decisions. We formulate this as an out-of-distribution moral alignment problem, where LLM agents must learn to apply consistent moral reasoning frameworks to scenarios beyond their training distribution. We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research. These findings establish that LLM agents can be systematically trained to internalize and apply specific moral frameworks to novel situations, providing a critical foundation for AI safety as language models become more integrated into human decision-making processes.",human
"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to various adversarial perturbations. To address the safety concerns arising from these vulnerabilities, adversarial training (AT) has emerged as one of the most effective paradigms for enhancing the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT frameworks primarily focus on a single or a limited set of attack types, leaving DNNs still exposed to attack types that may be encountered in practice but not addressed during training. In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS) to address these issues. From the optimization perspective within the multi-armed bandit framework, it dynamically designs rewards and balances exploration and exploitation by considering the dynamic and interdependent characteristics of multiple robustness dimensions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CAS achieves superior overall robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy, providing a new paradigm for robust generalization of DNNs.",human
"Cross-Video Reasoning (CVR) presents a significant challenge in video understanding, which requires simultaneous understanding of multiple videos to aggregate and compare information across groups of videos. Most existing video understanding benchmarks focus on single-video analysis, failing to assess the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to simultaneously reason over various videos. Recent benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multi-view videos that capture different perspectives of the same scene. However, their limited tasks hinder a thorough assessment of MLLMs in diverse real-world CVR scenarios. To this end, we introduce CrossVid, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning ability in cross-video contexts. Firstly, CrossVid encompasses a wide spectrum of hierarchical tasks, comprising four high-level dimensions and ten specific tasks, thereby closely reflecting the complex and varied nature of real-world video understanding. Secondly, CrossVid provides 5,331 videos, along with 9,015 challenging question-answering pairs, spanning single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended question formats. Through extensive experiments on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5-Pro performs best on CrossVid, achieving an average accuracy of 50.4%. Notably, our in-depth case study demonstrates that most current MLLMs struggle with CVR tasks, primarily due to their inability to integrate or compare evidence distributed across multiple videos for reasoning. These insights highlight the potential of CrossVid to guide future advancements in enhancing MLLMs' CVR capabilities.",human
"Incomplete multi-view unsupervised feature selection (IMUFS), which aims to identify representative features from unlabeled multi-view data containing missing values, has received growing attention in recent years. Despite their promising performance, existing methods face three key challenges: 1) by focusing solely on the view-missing problem, they are not well-suited to the more prevalent mixed-missing scenario in practice, where some samples lack entire views or only partial features within views; 2) insufficient utilization of consistency and diversity across views limits the effectiveness of feature selection; and 3) the lack of theoretical analysis makes it unclear how feature selection and data imputation interact during the joint learning process. Being aware of these, we propose CLIM-FS, a novel IMUFS method designed to address the mixed-missing problem. Specifically, we integrate the imputation of both missing views and variables into a feature selection model based on nonnegative orthogonal matrix factorization, enabling the joint learning of feature selection and adaptive data imputation. Furthermore, we fully leverage consensus cluster structure and cross-view local geometrical structure to enhance the synergistic learning process. We also provide a theoretical analysis to clarify the underlying collaborative mechanism of CLIM-FS. Experimental results on eight real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that CLIM-FS outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",human
"We approach the search for optimal element ordering in bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and have built an RL agent that learns to perform such global optimisation using the geometric graph representation of the NPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we train an RL agent to perform composition-conserving atomic swap actions on the icosahedral nanoparticle structure. Trained once on randomised $Ag_{X}Au_{309-X}$ compositions and orderings, the agent discovers previously established ground state structure. We show that this optimization is robust to differently ordered initialisations of the same NP compositions. We also demonstrate that a trained policy can extrapolate effectively to NPs of unseen size. However, the efficacy is limited when multiple alloying elements are involved. Our results demonstrate that RL with pre-trained equivariant graph encodings can navigate combinatorial ordering spaces at the nanoparticle scale, and offer a transferable optimisation strategy with the potential to generalise across composition and reduce repeated individual search cost.",human
"We propose a prompt-conditioned framework built on MedSigLIP that injects textual priors via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) and multi-scale pooling. Text prompts condition patch-token features on clinical intent, enabling data-efficient learning and rapid adaptation. The architecture combines global, local, and texture-aware pooling through separate regression heads fused by a lightweight MLP, trained with pairwise ranking loss. Evaluated on the LDCTIQA2023 (a public LDCT quality assessment challenge) with 1,000 training images, we achieve PLCC = 0.9575, SROCC = 0.9561, and KROCC = 0.8301, surpassing the top-ranked published challenge submissions and demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt-guided approach.",human
"Mobile agents show immense potential, yet current state-of-the-art (SoTA) agents exhibit inadequate success rates on real-world, long-horizon, cross-application tasks. We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation.",human
"Recent advances in contextualized word embeddings have greatly improved semantic tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and contextual similarity, but most progress has been limited to high-resource languages like English. Vietnamese, in contrast, still lacks robust models and evaluation resources for fine-grained semantic understanding. In this paper, we present ViConBERT, a novel framework for learning Vietnamese contextualized embeddings that integrates contrastive learning (SimCLR) and gloss-based distillation to better capture word meaning. We also introduce ViConWSD, the first large-scale synthetic dataset for evaluating semantic understanding in Vietnamese, covering both WSD and contextual similarity. Experimental results show that ViConBERT outperforms strong baselines on WSD (F1 = 0.87) and achieves competitive performance on ViCon (AP = 0.88) and ViSim-400 (Spearman's rho = 0.60), demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling both discrete senses and graded semantic relations.

"Block-Matching and 3D Filtering (BM3D) exploits non-local self-similarity priors for denoising but relies on fixed parameters. Deep models such as U-Net are more flexible but often lack interpretability and fail to generalize across noise regimes. In this study, we propose Deep Unfolded BM3D (DU-BM3D), a hybrid framework that unrolls BM3D into a trainable architecture by replacing its fixed collaborative filtering with a learnable U-Net denoiser. This preserves BM3D's non-local structural prior while enabling end-to-end optimization. We evaluate DU-BM3D on low-dose CT (LDCT) denoising and show that it outperforms classic BM3D and standalone U-Net across simulated LDCT at different noise levels, yielding higher PSNR and SSIM, especially in high-noise conditions.",human
"The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.",human
"Unplanned extubation (UE) remains a critical patient safety concern in intensive care units (ICUs), often leading to severe complications or death. Real-time UE detection has been limited, largely due to the ethical and privacy challenges of obtaining annotated ICU video data. We propose Augmented Unplanned Removal Alert (AURA), a vision-based risk detection system developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset. By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition. This work demonstrates a novel pathway for developing privacy-preserving, reproducible patient safety monitoring systems with potential for deployment in intensive care settings.",human
"We present SCI, a closed-loop, control-theoretic framework that models interpretability as a regulated state. SCI formalizes the interpretive error Delta SP and actively drives SP(t) in [0, 1] (""Surgical Precision"") toward a target via a projected update on the parameters Theta under a human-gain budget. The framework operates through three coordinated components: (1) reliability-weighted, multiscale features P(t, s); (2) a knowledge-guided interpreter psi_Theta that emits traceable markers and rationales; and (3) a Lyapunov-guided controller equipped with rollback, trust-region safeguards, and a descent condition. Across biomedical (EEG/ECG/ICU), industrial (bearings/tool wear), and environmental (climate/seismic) domains, SCI reduces interpretive error by 25-42% (mean 38%, 95% confidence interval 22-43%) relative to static explainers while maintaining AUC/F1 within approximately 1-2 percentage points of baseline. SCI also reduces SP variance from 0.030 to 0.011, indicating substantially more stable explanations. Modeling interpretability as a control objective yields steadier, faster-recovering, and more trustworthy interpretive behavior across diverse signal regimes.",human
"World models have garnered substantial interest in the AI community. These are internal representations that simulate aspects of the external world, track entities and states, capture causal relationships, and enable prediction of consequences. This contrasts with representations based solely on statistical correlations. A key motivation behind this research direction is that humans possess such mental world models, and finding evidence of similar representations in AI models might indicate that these models ""understand"" the world in a human-like way. In this paper, we use case studies from the philosophy of science literature to critically examine whether the world model framework adequately characterizes human-level understanding. We focus on specific philosophical analyses where the distinction between world model capabilities and human understanding is most pronounced. While these represent particular views of understanding rather than universal definitions, they help us explore the limits of world models.",human
"Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable text generation capabilities, often hallucinate and generate text that is factually incorrect and not grounded in real-world knowledge. This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions. Our code is available here.",human
"Deep hashing improves retrieval efficiency through compact binary codes, yet it introduces severe and often overlooked privacy risks. The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems.",human
"The paper presents a multi-resource load balancing strategy which can be utilised within an agent-based system. This approach can assist system designers in their attempts to optimise the structure for complex enterprise architectures. In this system, the social behaviour of the agent and its adaptation abilities are applied to determine an optimal setup for a given configuration. All the methods have been developed to allow the agent's self-assessment. The proposed agent system has been implemented and the experiment results are presented here.",human
"Particle filters (PFs) are often combined with swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, such as Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), for particle rejuvenation. Separately, Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD) sampling is a common strategy for adaptively sizing the particle set. However, the theoretical interaction between SI-based rejuvenation kernels and KLD-based adaptive sampling is not yet fully understood.   This paper investigates this specific interaction. We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense.   By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound. The goal of this study is not to provide a fully general proof, but rather to offer a tractable theoretical framework that helps to interpret the computational efficiency empirically observed when combining these techniques, and to provide a starting point for designing more efficient adaptive filters.",human
"Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently produce hallucinations in the form of descriptions of objects, attributes, or relations that do not exist in the image due to over-reliance on language priors and imprecise cross-modal grounding. We introduce Spectral Representation Filtering (SRF), a lightweight, training-free method to suppress such hallucinations by analyzing and correcting the covariance structure of the model's representations. SRF identifies low-rank hallucination modes through eigendecomposition of the covariance of the differences between features collected for truthful and hallucinatory captions, revealing structured biases in the feature space. A soft spectral filter then attenuates these modes in the feed-forward projection weights of deeper vLLM layers, equalizing feature variance while preserving semantic fidelity. Unlike decoding or retraining-based approaches, SRF operates entirely post-hoc, incurs zero inference overhead, and requires no architectural modifications. Across three families of VLMs (LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, and mPLUG-Owl2), SRF consistently reduces hallucination rates on MSCOCO, POPE-VQA, and other visual tasks benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading caption quality.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that bypass safety guidelines and generate harmful content. Mitigating these vulnerabilities requires defense mechanisms that are both robust and computationally efficient. However, existing approaches either incur high computational costs or rely on lightweight defenses that can be easily circumvented, rendering them impractical for real-world LLM-based systems. In this work, we introduce the AlignTree defense, which enhances model alignment while maintaining minimal computational overhead. AlignTree monitors LLM activations during generation and detects misaligned behavior using an efficient random forest classifier. This classifier operates on two signals: (i) the refusal direction -- a linear representation that activates on misaligned prompts, and (ii) an SVM-based signal that captures non-linear features associated with harmful content. Unlike previous methods, AlignTree does not require additional prompts or auxiliary guard models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of AlignTree across multiple LLMs and benchmarks.",human
"Pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for ensuring safety in autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and urban planning applications. While early approaches primarily focus on one-hop pairwise relationships, recent studies attempt to capture high-order interactions by stacking multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers. However, these approaches face a fundamental trade-off: insufficient layers may lead to under-reaching problems that limit the model's receptive field, while excessive depth can result in prohibitive computational costs. We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design. This combination enables flexible and scalable reasoning across varying interaction patterns. Experiments on three benchmarks (ETH/UCY, NBA, and SDD) demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating both its effectiveness and practical efficiency.",human
"Fine-grained entity recognition is crucial for reasoning and decision-making in task-oriented dialogues, yet current large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in domain adaptation and retrieval controllability. We introduce MME-RAG, a Multi-Manager-Expert Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that decomposes entity recognition into two coordinated stages: type-level judgment by lightweight managers and span-level extraction by specialized experts. Each expert is supported by a KeyInfo retriever that injects semantically aligned, few-shot exemplars during inference, enabling precise and domain-adaptive extraction without additional training. Experiments on CrossNER, MIT-Movie, MIT-Restaurant, and our newly constructed multi-domain customer-service dataset demonstrate that MME-RAG performs better than recent baselines in most domains. Ablation studies further show that both the hierarchical decomposition and KeyInfo-guided retrieval are key drivers of robustness and cross-domain generalization, establishing MME-RAG as a scalable and interpretable solution for adaptive dialogue understanding.",human
"This paper studies the removal of salt-and-pepper noise from images using median filter (MF) and simple three-layer autoencoder (AE) within recursive threshold algorithm. The performance of denoising is assessed with two metrics: the standard Structural Similarity Index SSIMImg of restored and clean images and a newly applied metric SSIMMap - the SSIM of entropy maps of these images computed via 2D Sample Entropy in sliding windows. We shown that SSIMMap is more sensitive to blur and local intensity transitions and complements SSIMImg. Experiments on low- and high-resolution grayscales images demonstrate that recursive threshold MF robustly restores images even under strong noise (50-60 %), whereas simple AE is only capable of restoring images with low levels of noise (<30 %). We propose two scalable schemes: (i) 2MF, which uses two MFs with different window sizes and a final thresholding step, effective for highlighting sharp local details at low resolution; and (ii) MFs-AE, which aggregates features from multiple MFs via an AE and is beneficial for restoring the overall scene structure at higher resolution. Owing to its simplicity and computational efficiency, MF remains preferable for deployment on resource-constrained platforms (edge/IoT), whereas AE underperforms without prior denoising. The results also validate the practical value of SSIMMap for objective blur assessment and denoising parameter tuning.",human
"With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), aligning them with human values for safety and ethics has become a critical challenge. This problem is especially challenging when multiple, potentially conflicting human values must be considered and balanced. Although several variants of existing alignment methods (such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)) have been proposed to address multi-value alignment, they suffer from notable limitations: 1) they are often unstable and inefficient in multi-value optimization; and 2) they fail to effectively handle value conflicts. As a result, these approaches typically struggle to achieve optimal trade-offs when aligning multiple values.   To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Value Alignment (MVA). It mitigates alignment degradation caused by parameter interference among diverse human values by minimizing their mutual information. Furthermore, we propose a value extrapolation strategy to efficiently explore the Pareto frontier, thereby constructing a set of LLMs with diverse value preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVA consistently outperforms existing baselines in aligning LLMs with multiple human values.",human
"Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to improve factual accuracy by leveraging structured knowledge. However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark. Through extensive experiments, we show that DoM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",human
"Road safety is a critical global concern, with manual enforcement of helmet laws and vehicle safety standards (e.g., rear-view mirror presence) being resource-intensive and inconsistent. This paper presents an AI-powered system to automate traffic violation detection, significantly enhancing enforcement efficiency and road safety. The system leverages YOLOv8 for robust object detection and EasyOCR for license plate recognition. Trained on a custom dataset of annotated images (augmented for diversity), it identifies helmet non-compliance, the absence of rear-view mirrors on motorcycles, an innovative contribution to automated checks, and extracts vehicle registration numbers. A Streamlit-based interface facilitates real-time monitoring and violation logging. Advanced image preprocessing enhances license plate recognition, particularly under challenging conditions. Based on evaluation results, the model achieves an overall precision of 0.9147, a recall of 0.886, and a mean Average Precision (mAP@50) of 0.843. The mAP@50 95 of 0.503 further indicates strong detection capability under stricter IoU thresholds. This work demonstrates a practical and effective solution for automated traffic rule enforcement, with considerations for real-world deployment discussed.",human
"We present a unified approach for constraint displacement problems in which a robot finds a feasible path by displacing constraints or obstacles. To this end, we propose a two stage process that returns locally optimal obstacle displacements to enable a feasible path for the robot. The first stage proceeds by computing a trajectory through the obstacles while minimizing an appropriate objective function. In the second stage, these obstacles are displaced to make the computed robot trajectory feasible, that is, collision-free. Several examples are provided that successfully demonstrate our approach on two distinct classes of constraint displacement problems.",human
"The surrogate gradient (SG) method has shown significant promise in enhancing the performance of deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), but it also introduces vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and their implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potentials lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG functions, and spike encoding schemes.",human
"Many machine learning tasks aim to find models that work well not for a single, but for a group of criteria, often opposing ones. One such example is imbalanced data classification, where, on the one hand, we want to achieve the best possible classification quality for data from the minority class without degrading the classification quality of the majority class. One solution is to propose an aggregate learning criterion and reduce the multi-objective learning task to a single-criteria optimization problem. Unfortunately, such an approach is characterized by ambiguity of interpretation since the value of the aggregated criterion does not indicate the value of the component criteria. Hence, there are more and more proposals for algorithms based on multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can simultaneously optimize multiple criteria. However, such an approach results in a set of multiple non-dominated solutions (Pareto front). The selection of a single solution from the Pareto front is a challenge itself, and much attention is paid to the issue of how to select it considering user preferences, as well as how to compare solutions returned by different MOO algorithms among themselves. Thus, a significant gap has been identified in the classifier evaluation methodology, i.e., how to reliably compare methods returning single solutions with algorithms returning solutions in the form of Pareto fronts.   To fill the aforementioned gap, this article proposes a new, reliable way of evaluating algorithms based on multi-objective algorithms with methods that return single solutions while pointing out solutions from a Pareto front tailored to the user's preferences. This work focuses only on algorithm comparison, not their learning. The algorithms selected for this study are illustrative to help understand the proposed approach.",human
"Automatic algorithm configuration tools such as irace efficiently tune parameter values but leave algorithmic code unchanged. This paper introduces a first version of irace-evo, an extension of irace that integrates code evolution through large language models (LLMs) to jointly explore parameter and code spaces. The proposed framework enables multi-language support (e.g., C++, Python), reduces token consumption via progressive context management, and employs the Always-From-Original principle to ensure robust and controlled code evolution. We evaluate irace-evo on the Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt (CMSA) metaheuristic for the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (VSBPP). Experimental results show that irace-evo can discover new algorithm variants that outperform the state-of-the-art CMSA implementation while maintaining low computational and monetary costs. Notably, irace-evo generates competitive algorithmic improvements using lightweight models (e.g., Claude Haiku 3.5) with a total usage cost under 2 euros. These results demonstrate that coupling automatic configuration with LLM-driven code evolution provides a powerful, cost-efficient avenue for advancing heuristic design and metaheuristic optimization.",human
"The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in training large-scale models. As the model size continues to scale, concerns are growing about the depletion of high-quality, well-curated training data. This has led practitioners to explore training approaches like Federated Learning (FL), which can leverage the abundant data on edge devices while maintaining privacy. However, the decentralization of training datasets in FL introduces challenges to scaling large models, a topic that remains under-explored. This paper fills this gap and provides qualitative insights on generalizing the previous model scaling experience to federated learning scenarios. Specifically, we derive a PAC-Bayes (Probably Approximately Correct Bayesian) upper bound for the generalization error of models trained with stochastic algorithms in federated settings and quantify the impact of distributed training data on the optimal model size by finding the analytic solution of model size that minimizes this bound. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the optimal model size has a negative power law relationship with the number of clients if the total training compute is unchanged. Besides, we also find that switching to FL with the same training compute will inevitably reduce the upper bound of generalization performance that the model can achieve through training, and that estimating the optimal model size in federated scenarios should depend on the average training compute across clients. Furthermore, we also empirically validate the correctness of our results with extensive training runs on different models, network settings, and datasets.",human
"Obtaining 3D conformations of realistic polyatomic molecules at the quantum chemistry level remains challenging, and although recent machine learning advances offer promise, predicting large-molecule structures still requires substantial computational effort. Here, we introduce StoL, a diffusion model-based framework that enables rapid and knowledge-free generation of large molecular structures from small-molecule data. Remarkably, StoL assembles molecules in a LEGO-style fashion from scratch, without seeing the target molecules or any structures of comparable size during training. Given a SMILES input, it decomposes the molecule into chemically valid fragments, generates their 3D structures with a diffusion model trained on small molecules, and assembles them into diverse conformations. This fragment-based strategy eliminates the need for large-molecule training data while maintaining high scalability and transferability. By embedding chemical principles into key steps, StoL ensures faster convergence, chemically rational structures, and broad configurational coverage, as confirmed against DFT calculations.",human
"Autoregressive (AR) approaches, which represent images as sequences of discrete tokens from a finite codebook, have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, the quantization process and the limited codebook size inevitably discard fine-grained information, placing bottlenecks on fidelity. Motivated by this limitation, recent studies have explored autoregressive modeling in continuous latent spaces, which offers higher generation quality. Yet, unlike discrete tokens constrained by a fixed codebook, continuous representations lie in a vast and unstructured space, posing significant challenges for efficient autoregressive modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce MixAR, a novel framework that leverages mixture training paradigms to inject discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous AR modeling. MixAR is a factorized formulation that leverages discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous autoregressive prediction. We investigate several discrete-continuous mixture strategies, including self-attention (DC-SA), cross-attention (DC-CA), and a simple approach (DC-Mix) that replaces homogeneous mask tokens with informative discrete counterparts. Moreover, to bridge the gap between ground-truth training tokens and inference tokens produced by the pre-trained AR model, we propose Training-Inference Mixture (TI-Mix) to achieve consistent training and generation distributions. In our experiments, we demonstrate a favorable balance of the DC-Mix strategy between computational efficiency and generation fidelity, and consistent improvement of TI-Mix.",human
"Contrastive learning has emerged as a cornerstone of unsupervised representation learning across vision, language, and graph domains, with InfoNCE as its dominant objective. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of InfoNCE remain limited. In this work, we introduce an explicit feature space to model augmented views of samples and a transition probability matrix to capture data augmentation dynamics. We demonstrate that InfoNCE optimizes the probability of two views sharing the same source toward a constant target defined by this matrix, naturally inducing feature clustering in the representation space. Leveraging this insight, we propose Scaled Convergence InfoNCE (SC-InfoNCE), a novel loss function that introduces a tunable convergence target to flexibly control feature similarity alignment. By scaling the target matrix, SC-InfoNCE enables flexible control over feature similarity alignment, allowing the training objective to better match the statistical properties of downstream data. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including image, graph, and text tasks, show that SC-InfoNCE consistently achieves strong and reliable performance across diverse domains.",human
"Charging optimization is a key challenge to the implementation of quantum batteries, particularly under inhomogeneity and partial observability. This paper employs reinforcement learning to optimize piecewise-constant charging policies for an inhomogeneous Dicke battery. We systematically compare policies across four observability regimes, from full-state access to experimentally accessible observables (energies of individual two-level systems (TLSs), first-order averages, and second-order correlations). Simulation results demonstrate that full observability yields near-optimal ergotropy with low variability, while under partial observability, access to only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages lags behind the fully observed baseline. However, augmenting partial observations with second-order correlations recovers most of the gap, reaching 94%-98% of the full-state baseline. The learned schedules are nonmyopic, trading temporary plateaus or declines for superior terminal outcomes. These findings highlight a practical route to effective fast-charging protocols under realistic information constraints.",human

"Diffusion models have shown great promise in data generation, yet generating time series data remains challenging due to the need to capture complex temporal dependencies and structural patterns. In this paper, we present \textit{TSGDiff}, a novel framework that rethinks time series generation from a graph-based perspective. Specifically, we represent time series as dynamic graphs, where edges are constructed based on Fourier spectrum characteristics and temporal dependencies. A graph neural network-based encoder-decoder architecture is employed to construct a latent space, enabling the diffusion process to model the structural representation distribution of time series effectively. Furthermore, we propose the Topological Structure Fidelity (Topo-FID) score, a graph-aware metric for assessing the structural similarity of time series graph representations. Topo-FID integrates two sub-metrics: Graph Edit Similarity, which quantifies differences in adjacency matrices, and Structural Entropy Similarity, which evaluates the entropy of node degree distributions. This comprehensive metric provides a more accurate assessment of structural fidelity in generated time series. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that \textit{TSGDiff} generates high-quality synthetic time series data generation, faithfully preserving temporal dependencies and structural integrity, thereby advancing the field of synthetic time series generation.",human
"This manuscript addresses the challenge of designing functionally graded materials (FGMs) for arbitrary-shaped domains. Towards this goal, the present work proposes a generic volume fraction profile generation algorithm based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The proposed algorithm can handle complex-shaped domains and generate smooth FGM profiles while adhering to the specified volume fraction values at boundaries/part of boundaries. The resulting design space from GPR comprises diverse profiles, enhancing the potential for discovering optimal configurations. Further, the algorithm allows the user to control the smoothness of the underlying profiles and the size of the design space through a length scale parameter. Further, the proposed profile generation scheme is coupled with the genetic algorithm to find the optimum FGM profiles for a given application. To make the genetic algorithm consistent with the GPR profile generation scheme, the standard simulated binary crossover operator in the genetic algorithm has been modified with a projection operator. We present numerous thermoelastic optimization examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed profile generation algorithm and optimization framework.",human
"Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete 3D shapes from partial observations, which is a challenging problem due to severe occlusions and missing geometry. Despite recent advances in multimodal techniques that leverage complementary RGB images to compensate for missing geometry, most methods still follow a Completion-by-Inpainting paradigm, synthesizing missing structures from fused latent features. We empirically show that this paradigm often results in structural inconsistencies and topological artifacts due to limited geometric and semantic constraints. To address this, we rethink the task and propose a more robust paradigm, termed Completion-by-Correction, which begins with a topologically complete shape prior generated by a pretrained image-to-3D model and performs feature-space correction to align it with the partial observation. This paradigm shifts completion from unconstrained synthesis to guided refinement, enabling structurally consistent and observation-aligned reconstruction. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce PGNet, a multi-stage framework that conducts dual-feature encoding to ground the generative prior, synthesizes a coarse yet structurally aligned scaffold, and progressively refines geometric details via hierarchical correction. Experiments on the ShapeNetViPC dataset demonstrate the superiority of PGNet over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of average Chamfer Distance (-23.5%) and F-score (+7.1%).",human
"DatalogMTL extends the classical Datalog language with metric temporal logic (MTL), enabling expressive reasoning over temporal data. While existing reasoning approaches, such as materialisation based and automata based methods, offer soundness and completeness, they lack support for handling efficient dynamic updates, a crucial requirement for real-world applications that involve frequent data updates. In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations. We have implemented this approach and tested it on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that DRedMTL often significantly outperforms rematerialisation, sometimes by orders of magnitude.",human
"The extensive use of pesticides and synthetic dyes poses critical threats to food safety, human health, and environmental sustainability, necessitating rapid and reliable detection methods. Raman spectroscopy offers molecularly specific fingerprints but suffers from spectral noise, fluorescence background, and band overlap, limiting its real-world applicability. Here, we propose a deep learning framework based on ResNet-18 feature extraction, combined with advanced classifiers, including XGBoost, SVM, and their hybrid integration, to detect pesticides and dyes from Raman spectroscopy, called MLRaman. The MLRaman with the CNN-XGBoost model achieved a predictive accuracy of 97.4% and a perfect AUC of 1.0, while it with the CNN-SVM model provided competitive results with robust class-wise discrimination. Dimensionality reduction analyses (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) confirmed the separability of Raman embeddings across 10 analytes, including 7 pesticides and 3 dyes. Finally, we developed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time prediction, which successfully identified unseen Raman spectra from our independent experiments and also literature sources, underscoring strong generalization capacity. This study establishes a scalable, practical MLRaman model for multi-residue contaminant monitoring, with significant potential for deployment in food safety and environmental surveillance.",human
"Hash center-based deep hashing methods improve upon pairwise or triplet-based approaches by assigning fixed hash centers to each class as learning targets, thereby avoiding the inefficiency of local similarity optimization. However, random center initialization often disregards inter-class semantic relationships. While existing two-stage methods mitigate this by first refining hash centers with semantics and then training the hash function, they introduce additional complexity, computational overhead, and suboptimal performance due to stage-wise discrepancies. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{Center-Reassigned Hashing (CRH)}$, an end-to-end framework that $\textbf{dynamically reassigns hash centers}$ from a preset codebook while jointly optimizing the hash function. Unlike previous methods, CRH adapts hash centers to the data distribution $\textbf{without explicit center optimization phases}$, enabling seamless integration of semantic relationships into the learning process. Furthermore, $\textbf{a multi-head mechanism}$ enhances the representational capacity of hash centers, capturing richer semantic structures. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that CRH learns semantically meaningful hash centers and outperforms state-of-the-art deep hashing methods in retrieval tasks.",human
"Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) with search engines enables large language models to iteratively retrieve up-to-date external knowledge, enhancing adaptability and generalization in complex question-answering tasks. However, existing search agent pipelines typically depend on reinforcement learning based optimization, which often suffers from sparse outcome rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and unstable training. We introduce CriticSearch, a fine-grained credit-assignment framework that supplies dense, turn-level feedback via a retrospective critic mechanism. During training, a frozen, asymmetric critique LLM retrospectively evaluates each turn using privileged information from the full trajectory and gold answers, converting these assessments into stable, dense rewards that guide policy improvement. Experimental results across diverse multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CriticSearch consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving faster convergence, improved training stability, and higher performance.",human
"Many bioacoustics, neuroscience, and linguistics research utilize birdsongs as proxy models to acquire knowledge in diverse areas. Developing models generally requires precisely annotated data at the level of syllables. Hence, automated and data-efficient methods that reduce annotation costs are in demand. This work presents a lightweight, yet performant neural network architecture for birdsong annotation called Residual-MLP-RNN. Then, it presents a robust three-stage training pipeline for developing reliable deep birdsong syllable detectors with minimal expert labor. The first stage is self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. Two of the most successful pretraining paradigms are explored, namely, masked prediction and online clustering. The second stage is supervised training with effective data augmentations to create a robust model for frame-level syllable detection. The third stage is semi-supervised post-training, which leverages the unlabeled data again. However, unlike the initial phase, this time it is aligned with the downstream task. The performance of this data-efficient approach is demonstrated for the complex song of the Canary in extreme label-scarcity scenarios. Canary has one of the most difficult songs to annotate, which implicitly validates the method for other birds. Finally, the potential of self-supervised embeddings is assessed for linear probing and unsupervised birdsong analysis.",human
"Large language models exhibit systematic vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks despite extensive safety alignment. We provide a mechanistic analysis revealing that position-dependent gradient weakening during autoregressive training creates signal decay, leading to incomplete safety learning where safety training fails to transform model preferences in later response regions fully. We introduce base-favored tokens -- vocabulary elements where base models assign higher probability than aligned models -- as computational indicators of incomplete safety learning and develop a targeted completion method that addresses undertrained regions through adaptive penalties and hybrid teacher distillation. Experimental evaluation across Llama and Qwen model families demonstrates dramatic improvements in adversarial robustness, with 48--98% reductions in attack success rates while preserving general capabilities. These results establish both a mechanistic understanding and practical solutions for fundamental limitations in safety alignment methodologies.",human
"We introduced a multimodal foundational model for financial transactions that integrates both structured attributes and unstructured textual descriptions into a unified representation. By adapting masked language modeling to transaction sequences, we demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms classical feature engineering and discrete event sequence methods but is also particularly effective in data-scarce Open Banking scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study across thousands of financial institutions in North America, providing evidence that multimodal representations can generalize across geographies and institutions. These results highlight the potential of self-supervised models to advance financial applications ranging from fraud prevention and credit risk to customer insights",human
"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to interpret natural-language instructions and perform diverse tasks, yet their integration of perception, language, and control introduces new safety vulnerabilities. Despite growing interest in attacking such models, the effectiveness of existing techniques remains unclear due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. One major issue is that differences in action tokenizers across VLA architectures hinder reproducibility and fair comparison. More importantly, most existing attacks have not been validated in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose AttackVLA, a unified framework that aligns with the VLA development lifecycle, covering data construction, model training, and inference. Within this framework, we implement a broad suite of attacks, including all existing attacks targeting VLAs and multiple adapted attacks originally developed for vision-language models, and evaluate them in both simulation and real-world settings. Our analysis of existing attacks reveals a critical gap: current methods tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorVLA, a targeted backdoor attack that compels a VLA to execute an attacker-specified long-horizon action sequence whenever a trigger is present. We evaluate BackdoorVLA in both simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic settings, achieving an average targeted success rate of 58.4% and reaching 100% on selected tasks. Our work provides a standardized framework for evaluating VLA vulnerabilities and demonstrates the potential for precise adversarial manipulation, motivating further research on securing VLA-based embodied systems.",human
"Modeling normal behavior in dynamic, nonlinear time series data is challenging for effective anomaly detection. Traditional methods, such as nearest neighbor and clustering approaches, often depend on rigid assumptions, such as a predefined number of reliable neighbors or clusters, which frequently break down in complex temporal scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Granular-ball One-Class Network (GBOC), a novel approach based on a data-adaptive representation called Granular-ball Vector Data Description (GVDD). GVDD partitions the latent space into compact, high-density regions represented by granular-balls, which are generated through a density-guided hierarchical splitting process and refined by removing noisy structures. Each granular-ball serves as a prototype for local normal behavior, naturally positioning itself between individual instances and clusters while preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. During training, GBOC improves the compactness of representations by aligning samples with their nearest granular-ball centers. During inference, anomaly scores are computed based on the distance to the nearest granular-ball. By focusing on dense, high-quality regions and significantly reducing the number of prototypes, GBOC delivers both robustness and efficiency in anomaly detection. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to handle the challenges of time series anomaly detection.",human
"Mitigating the negative impact of noisy labels has been aperennial issue in supervised learning. Robust loss functions have emerged as a prevalent solution to this problem. In this work, we introduce the Variation Ratio as a novel property related to the robustness of loss functions, and propose a new family of robust loss functions, termed Variation-Bounded Loss (VBL), which is characterized by a bounded variation ratio. We provide theoretical analyses of the variation ratio, proving that a smaller variation ratio would lead to better robustness. Furthermore, we reveal that the variation ratio provides a feasible method to relax the symmetric condition and offers a more concise path to achieve the asymmetric condition. Based on the variation ratio, we reformulate several commonly used loss functions into a variation-bounded form for practical applications. Positive experiments on various datasets exhibit the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.",human
"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have unlocked powerful cross-modal capabilities, but still significantly suffer from hallucinations. As such, accurate detection of hallucinations in MLLMs is imperative for ensuring their reliability in practical applications. To this end, guided by the principle of ""Seeing is Believing"", we introduce VBackChecker, a novel reference-free hallucination detection framework that verifies the consistency of MLLMgenerated responses with visual inputs, by leveraging a pixellevel Grounding LLM equipped with reasoning and referring segmentation capabilities. This reference-free framework not only effectively handles rich-context scenarios, but also offers interpretability. To facilitate this, an innovative pipeline is accordingly designed for generating instruction-tuning data (R-Instruct), featuring rich-context descriptions, grounding masks, and hard negative samples. We further establish R^2 -HalBench, a new hallucination benchmark for MLLMs, which, unlike previous benchmarks, encompasses real-world, rich-context descriptions from 18 MLLMs with high-quality annotations, spanning diverse object-, attribute, and relationship-level details. VBackChecker outperforms prior complex frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on R^2 -HalBench, even rivaling GPT-4o's capabilities in hallucination detection. It also surpasses prior methods in the pixel-level grounding task, achieving over a 10% improvement. All codes, data, and models are available at https://github.com/PinxueGuo/VBackChecker.",human
"Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an advanced load monitoring technique that uses data-driven algorithms to disaggregate the total power consumption of a household into the consumption of individual appliances. However, real-world NILM deployment still faces major challenges, including overfitting, low model generalization, and disaggregating a large number of appliances operating at the same time. To address these challenges, this work proposes an end-to-end framework for the NILM classification task, which consists of high-frequency labeled data, a feature extraction method, and a lightweight neural network. Within this framework, we introduce a novel feature extraction method that fuses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features. Moreover, we propose a lightweight architecture for multi-label NILM classification (Fusion-ResNet). The proposed feature-based model achieves a higher $F1$ score on average and across different appliances compared to state-of-the-art NILM classifiers while minimizing the training and inference time. Finally, we assessed the performance of our model against baselines with a varying number of simultaneously active devices. Results demonstrate that Fusion-ResNet is relatively robust to stress conditions with up to 15 concurrently active appliances.",human
"Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.",human
"Aligning molecular sequence representations (e.g., SMILES notations) with textual descriptions is critical for applications spanning drug discovery, materials design, and automated chemical literature analysis. Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.",human
"Goal-driven persuasive dialogue, exemplified by applications like telemarketing, requires sophisticated multi-turn planning and strict factual faithfulness, which remains a significant challenge for even state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). A lack of task-specific data often limits previous works, and direct LLM application suffers from strategic brittleness and factual hallucination. In this paper, we first construct and release TeleSalesCorpus, the first real-world-grounded dialogue dataset for this domain. We then propose AI-Salesman, a novel framework featuring a dual-stage architecture. For the training stage, we design a Bayesian-supervised reinforcement learning algorithm that learns robust sales strategies from noisy dialogues. For the inference stage, we introduce the Dynamic Outline-Guided Agent (DOGA), which leverages a pre-built script library to provide dynamic, turn-by-turn strategic guidance. Moreover, we design a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines fine-grained metrics for key sales skills with the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AI-Salesman significantly outperforms baseline models in both automatic metrics and comprehensive human evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in complex persuasive scenarios.",human
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for graph representation learning due to their effective message aggregation. However, this advantage also amplifies biases inherent in graph topology, raising fairness concerns. Existing fairness-aware GNNs provide satisfactory performance on fairness metrics such as Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity while maintaining acceptable accuracy trade-offs. Unfortunately, we observe that this pursuit of fairness metrics neglects the GNN's ability to predict negative labels, which renders their predictions with extremely high False Positive Rates (FPR), resulting in negative effects in high-risk scenarios. To this end, we advocate that classification performance should be carefully calibrated while improving fairness, rather than simply constraining accuracy loss. Furthermore, we propose Fair GNN via Structural Entropy (\textbf{FairGSE}), a novel framework that maximizes two-dimensional structural entropy (2D-SE) to improve fairness without neglecting false positives. Experiments on several real-world datasets show FairGSE reduces FPR by 39\% vs. state-of-the-art fairness-aware GNNs, with comparable fairness improvement.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a crucial tool in Visual Question Answering (VQA) for handling knowledge-intensive questions in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. However, their reliance on massive training datasets often causes them to inherit language biases during the acquisition of knowledge. This limitation imposes two key constraints on existing methods: (1) LLM predictions become less reliable due to bias exploitation, and (2) despite strong knowledge reasoning capabilities, LLMs still struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To address these issues, we propose Object Attribute Description Promoter (OAD-Promoter), a novel approach for enhancing LLM-based VQA by mitigating language bias and improving domain-shift robustness. OAD-Promoter comprises three components: the Object-concentrated Example Generation (OEG) module, the Memory Knowledge Assistance (MKA) module, and the OAD Prompt. The OEG module generates global captions and object-concentrated samples, jointly enhancing visual information input to the LLM and mitigating bias through complementary global and regional visual cues. The MKA module assists the LLM in handling OOD samples by retrieving relevant knowledge from stored examples to support questions from unseen domains. Finally, the OAD Prompt integrates the outputs of the preceding modules to optimize LLM inference. Experiments demonstrate that OAD-Promoter significantly improves the performance of LLM-based VQA methods in few-shot or zero-shot settings, achieving new state-of-the-art results.",human
"The rapid proliferation of multimodal social media content has driven research in Multimodal Conversational Stance Detection (MCSD), which aims to interpret users' attitudes toward specific targets within complex discussions. However, existing studies remain limited by: **1) pseudo-multimodality**, where visual cues appear only in source posts while comments are treated as text-only, misaligning with real-world multimodal interactions; and **2) user homogeneity**, where diverse users are treated uniformly, neglecting personal traits that shape stance expression. To address these issues, we introduce **U-MStance**, the first user-centric MCSD dataset, containing over 40k annotated comments across six real-world targets. We further propose **PRISM**, a **P**ersona-**R**easoned mult**I**modal **S**tance **M**odel for MCSD. PRISM first derives longitudinal user personas from historical posts and comments to capture individual traits, then aligns textual and visual cues within conversational context via Chain-of-Thought to bridge semantic and pragmatic gaps across modalities. Finally, a mutual task reinforcement mechanism is employed to jointly optimize stance detection and stance-aware response generation for bidirectional knowledge transfer. Experiments on U-MStance demonstrate that PRISM yields significant gains over strong baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of user-centric and context-grounded multimodal reasoning for realistic stance understanding.",human
"With the rapid development of deep learning, large language models have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical equation solving. However, their substantial computational and storage costs hinder practical deployment. This paper proposes a lightweight optimization method that integrates dynamic attention head pruning with knowledge distillation. The approach dynamically evaluates the importance of each attention head in the multi-head attention mechanism using a combination of weight norms and entropy, and prunes redundant heads in real time to reduce computational overhead. To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability. Experiments conducted on both Math23k and ASDiv-A verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, on Math23k with a 30% pruning ratio, parameters are reduced by 18.7%, inference speed is improved by 27.5%, FLOPs are reduced by 19.3%, and accuracy drops only 0.7% (from 84.4% to 83.7%). These results demonstrate that the method achieves substantial efficiency gains while maintaining strong reasoning performance, providing a practical solution for efficient deployment of large language models in mathematical reasoning tasks.",human
"In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), efficient exploration is crucial for optimizing the performance of joint policy. However, existing methods often update joint policies via independent agent exploration, without coordination among agents, which inherently constrains the expressive capacity and exploration of joint policies. To address this issue, we propose a conductor-based joint policy framework that directly enhances the expressive capacity of joint policies and coordinates exploration. In addition, we develop a Hierarchical Conductor-based Policy Optimization (HCPO) algorithm that instructs policy updates for the conductor and agents in a direction aligned with performance improvement. A rigorous theoretical guarantee further establishes the monotonicity of the joint policy optimization process. By deploying local conductors, HCPO retains centralized training benefits while eliminating inter-agent communication during execution. Finally, we evaluate HCPO on three challenging benchmarks: StarCraftII Multi-agent Challenge, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Multi-agent Particle Environment. The results indicate that HCPO outperforms competitive MARL baselines regarding cooperative efficiency and stability.",human
"This study addresses the problem of dynamic anomaly detection in accounting transactions and proposes a real-time detection method based on a Transformer to tackle the challenges of hidden abnormal behaviors and high timeliness requirements in complex trading environments. The approach first models accounting transaction data by representing multi-dimensional records as time-series matrices and uses embedding layers and positional encoding to achieve low-dimensional mapping of inputs. A sequence modeling structure with multi-head self-attention is then constructed to capture global dependencies and aggregate features from multiple perspectives, thereby enhancing the ability to detect abnormal patterns. The network further integrates feed-forward layers and regularization strategies to achieve deep feature representation and accurate anomaly probability estimation. To validate the effectiveness of the method, extensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset, including comparative analysis, hyperparameter sensitivity tests, environmental sensitivity tests, and data sensitivity tests. Results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline models in AUC, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall, and maintains stable performance under different environmental conditions and data perturbations. These findings confirm the applicability and advantages of the Transformer-based framework for dynamic anomaly detection in accounting transactions and provide methodological support for intelligent financial risk control and auditing.",human
"Multimodal learning often relies on aligning representations across modalities to enable effective information integration, an approach traditionally assumed to be universally beneficial. However, prior research has primarily taken an observational approach, examining naturally occurring alignment in multimodal data and exploring its correlation with model performance, without systematically studying the direct effects of explicitly enforced alignment between representations of different modalities. In this work, we investigate how explicit alignment influences both model performance and representation alignment under different modality-specific information structures. Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on textual data up to a specific temporal cutoff. This creates a strict knowledge boundary beyond which models cannot provide accurate information without querying external sources. More subtly, when this limitation is unknown or ignored, LLMs may inadvertently blend outdated time-sensitive information with general knowledge during reasoning tasks, potentially compromising response accuracy. We introduce LLMLagBench, an LLM freshness benchmark, as a systematic approach for identifying the earliest probable temporal boundaries of an LLM's training data by evaluating its knowledge of recent events. We then apply this benchmark to evaluate a large set of LLMs, including models with both explicitly declared and undeclared training cutoffs. The reliability of the benchmark is assessed by manual validation and comparison with publicly released information about LLM pretraining.",human
"Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, which can be effectively compressed into smaller models. However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B. First, most datasets typically ignore the relationship between training data knowledge and the model's inherent abilities, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance on smaller models.",human
"Despite the progress in medical image segmentation, most existing methods remain task-specific and lack interactivity. Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.",human
"In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of combining fine-tuning and backtranslation on a small Japanese corpus for neural machine translation. Starting from a baseline English{\textrightarrow}Japanese model (COMET = 0.460), we first apply backtranslation (BT) using synthetic data generated from monolingual Japanese corpora, yielding a modest increase (COMET = 0.468). Next, we fine-tune (FT) the model on a genuine small parallel dataset drawn from diverse Japanese news and literary corpora, achieving a substantial jump to COMET = 0.589 when using Mistral 7B. Finally, we integrate both backtranslation and fine-tuning{ -- }first augmenting the small dataset with BT generated examples, then adapting via FT{ -- }which further boosts performance to COMET = 0.597. These results demonstrate that, even with limited training data, the synergistic use of backtranslation and targeted fine-tuning on Japanese corpora can significantly enhance translation quality, outperforming each technique in isolation. This approach offers a lightweight yet powerful strategy for improving low-resource language pairs.",human
"We present TEMPO, a global, temporally resolved dataset of building density and height derived from high-resolution satellite imagery using deep learning models. We pair building footprint and height data from existing datasets with quarterly PlanetScope basemap satellite images to train a multi-task deep learning model that predicts building density and building height at a 37.6-meter per pixel resolution. We apply this model to global PlanetScope basemaps from Q1 2018 through Q2 2025 to create global, temporal maps of building density and height. We validate these maps by comparing against existing building footprint datasets. Our estimates achieve an F1 score between 85% and 88% on different hand-labeled subsets, and are temporally stable, with a 0.96 five-year trend-consistency score. TEMPO captures quarterly changes in built settlements at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable approaches, unlocking large-scale monitoring of development patterns and climate impacts essential for global resilience and adaptation efforts.",human
"Behavior Cloning (BC) is a data-driven supervised learning approach that has gained increasing attention with the success of scaling laws in language and vision domains. Among its implementations in robotic manipulation, Diffusion Policy (DP), with its two variants DP-CNN (DP-C) and DP-Transformer (DP-T), is one of the most effective and widely adopted models, demonstrating the advantages of predicting continuous action sequences. However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling.",human
"Modeling indoor radio propagation is crucial for wireless network planning and optimization. However, existing approaches often rely on labor-intensive manual modeling of geometry and material properties, resulting in limited scalability and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents SenseRay-3D, a generalizable and physics-informed end-to-end framework that predicts three-dimensional (3D) path-loss heatmaps directly from RGB-D scans, thereby eliminating the need for explicit geometry reconstruction or material annotation. The proposed framework builds a sensing-driven voxelized scene representation that jointly encodes occupancy, electromagnetic material characteristics, and transmitter-receiver geometry, which is processed by a SwinUNETR-based neural network to infer environmental path-loss relative to free-space path-loss. A comprehensive synthetic indoor propagation dataset is further developed to validate the framework and to serve as a standardized benchmark for future research. Experimental results show that SenseRay-3D achieves a mean absolute error of 4.27 dB on unseen environments and supports real-time inference at 217 ms per sample, demonstrating its scalability, efficiency, and physical consistency. SenseRay-3D paves a new path for sense-driven, generalizable, and physics-consistent modeling of indoor propagation, marking a major leap beyond our pioneering EM DeepRay framework.",human
"Excessive abstraction is a critical challenge in hand abstraction-a task specific to games like Texas hold'em-when solving large-scale imperfect-information games, as it impairs AI performance. This issue arises from extreme implementations of imperfect-recall abstraction, which entirely discard historical information. This paper presents KrwEmd, the first practical algorithm designed to address this problem. We first introduce the k-recall winrate feature, which not only qualitatively distinguishes signal observation infosets by leveraging both future and, crucially, historical game information, but also quantitatively captures their similarity. We then develop the KrwEmd algorithm, which clusters signal observation infosets using earth mover's distance to measure discrepancies between their features. Experimental results demonstrate that KrwEmd significantly improves AI gameplay performance compared to existing algorithms.",human
"Phishing and related cyber threats are becoming more varied and technologically advanced. Among these, email-based phishing remains the most dominant and persistent threat. These attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to disseminate malware or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Deep learning (DL) models, particularly transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced phishing mitigation through their contextual understanding of language. However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification. Robustness against text-based adversarial perturbations is reinforced using Fast Gradient Method (FGM) adversarial training. Furthermore, the framework integrates the LIME Explainable AI (XAI) technique to enhance the transparency of the DistilBERT architecture. The framework also uses the Flan-T5-small language model from Hugging Face to generate plain-language security narrative explanations for end-users. This combined approach ensures precise phishing classification while providing easily understandable justifications for the model's decisions.",human
"High-quality information set abstraction remains a core challenge in solving large-scale imperfect-information extensive-form games (IIEFGs)-such as no-limit Texas Hold'em-where the finite nature of spatial resources hinders strategy solving over the full game. State-of-the-art AI methods rely on pre-trained discrete clustering for abstraction, yet their hard classification irreversibly loses critical information: specifically, the quantifiable subtle differences between information sets-vital for strategy solving-thereby compromising the quality of such solving. Inspired by the word embedding paradigm in natural language processing, this paper proposes the Embedding CFR algorithm, a novel approach for solving strategies in IIEFGs within an embedding space. The algorithm pre-trains and embeds features of isolated information sets into an interconnected low-dimensional continuous space, where the resulting vectors more precisely capture both the distinctions and connections between information sets. Embedding CFR presents a strategy-solving process driven by regret accumulation and strategy updates within this embedding space, with accompanying theoretical analysis verifying its capacity to reduce cumulative regret. Experiments on poker show that with the same spatial overhead, Embedding CFR achieves significantly faster exploitability convergence compared to cluster-based abstraction algorithms, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm in poker AI that pre-trains information set abstractions through low-dimensional embedding for strategy solving.",human
"Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are highly effective for environmental monitoring, particularly for detecting temperature variations. However, the nonlinear nature of specklegram data presents significant challenges for accurate temperature prediction. This study investigates the use of transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Swin Transformers, and emerging models such as Learnable Importance Non-Symmetric Attention Vision Transformers (LINA-ViT) and Multi-Adaptive Proximity Vision Graph Attention Transformers (MAP-ViGAT), to predict temperature from specklegram data over a range of 0 to 120 Celsius. The results show that ViTs achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.15, outperforming traditional models such as CNNs. GAT-ViT and MAP-ViGAT variants also demonstrated competitive accuracy, highlighting the importance of adaptive attention mechanisms and graph-based structures in capturing complex modal interactions and phase shifts in specklegram data. Additionally, this study incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including attention maps and saliency maps, to provide insights into the decision-making processes of the transformer models, improving interpretability and transparency. These findings establish transformer architectures as strong benchmarks for optical fiber-based temperature sensing and offer promising directions for industrial monitoring and structural health assessment applications.",human
"Despite massive investments in scale, deep models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction often exhibit rapidly diminishing returns - a stark contrast to the smooth, predictable gains seen in large language models. We identify the root cause as a structural misalignment: Transformers assume sequential compositionality, while CTR data demand combinatorial reasoning over high-cardinality semantic fields. Unstructured attention spreads capacity indiscriminately, amplifying noise under extreme sparsity and breaking scalable learning. To restore alignment, we introduce the Field-Aware Transformer (FAT), which embeds field-based interaction priors into attention through decomposed content alignment and cross-field modulation. This design ensures model complexity scales with the number of fields F, not the total vocabulary size n >> F, leading to tighter generalization and, critically, observed power-law scaling in AUC as model width increases. We present the first formal scaling law for CTR models, grounded in Rademacher complexity, that explains and predicts this behavior. On large-scale benchmarks, FAT improves AUC by up to +0.51% over state-of-the-art methods. Deployed online, it delivers +2.33% CTR and +0.66% RPM. Our work establishes that effective scaling in recommendation arises not from size, but from structured expressivity-architectural coherence with data semantics.",human
"Adaptive treatment strategies (ATS) are sequential decision-making processes that enable personalized care by dynamically adjusting treatment decisions in response to evolving patient symptoms. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions.",human
"Generating expressive and controllable human speech is one of the core goals of generative artificial intelligence, but its progress has long been constrained by two fundamental challenges: the deep entanglement of speech factors and the coarse granularity of existing control mechanisms. To overcome these challenges, we have proposed a novel framework called MF-Speech, which consists of two core components: MF-SpeechEncoder and MF-SpeechGenerator. MF-SpeechEncoder acts as a factor purifier, adopting a multi-objective optimization strategy to decompose the original speech signal into highly pure and independent representations of content, timbre, and emotion. Subsequently, MF-SpeechGenerator functions as a conductor, achieving precise, composable and fine-grained control over these factors through dynamic fusion and Hierarchical Style Adaptive Normalization (HSAN). Experiments demonstrate that in the highly challenging multi-factor compositional speech generation task, MF-Speech significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a lower word error rate (WER=4.67%), superior style control (SECS=0.5685, Corr=0.68), and the highest subjective evaluation scores(nMOS=3.96, sMOS_emotion=3.86, sMOS_style=3.78). Furthermore, the learned discrete factors exhibit strong transferability, demonstrating their significant potential as a general-purpose speech representation.",human
"Understanding the legally relevant factual basis of an event and conveying it through text is a key skill of legal professionals. This skill is important for preparing forms (e.g., insurance claims) or other legal documents (e.g., court claims), but often presents a challenge for laypeople. Current AI approaches aim to bridge this gap, but mostly rely on the user to articulate what has happened in text, which may be challenging for many. Here, we investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to understand and summarize events occurring in videos. We ask an LLM to summarize and draft legal letters, based on 120 YouTube videos showing legal issues in various domains. Overall, 71.7\% of the summaries were rated as of high or medium quality, which is a promising result, opening the door to a number of applications in e.g. access to justice.",human
"Electroencephalography (EEG) offers detailed access to neural dynamics but remains constrained by noise and trial-by-trial variability, limiting decoding performance in data-restricted or complex paradigms. Data augmentation is often employed to enhance feature representations, yet conventional uniform averaging overlooks differences in trial informativeness and can degrade representational quality. We introduce a weighted bootstrapping approach that prioritizes more reliable trials to generate higher-quality augmented samples. In a Sentence Evaluation paradigm, weights were computed from relative ERP differences and applied during probabilistic sampling and averaging. Across conditions, weighted bootstrapping improved decoding accuracy relative to unweighted (from 68.35% to 71.25% at best), demonstrating that emphasizing reliable trials strengthens representational quality. The results demonstrate that reliability-based augmentation yields more robust and discriminative EEG representations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lyricists/NeuroBootstrap.",human
"Sounding Video Generation (SVG) remains a challenging task due to the inherent structural misalignment between audio and video, as well as the high computational cost of multimodal data processing. In this paper, we introduce ProAV-DiT, a Projected Latent Diffusion Transformer designed for efficient and synchronized audio-video generation. To address structural inconsistencies, we preprocess raw audio into video-like representations, aligning both the temporal and spatial dimensions between audio and video. At its core, ProAV-DiT adopts a Multi-scale Dual-stream Spatio-Temporal Autoencoder (MDSA), which projects both modalities into a unified latent space using orthogonal decomposition, enabling fine-grained spatiotemporal modeling and semantic alignment. To further enhance temporal coherence and modality-specific fusion, we introduce a multi-scale attention mechanism, which consists of multi-scale temporal self-attention and group cross-modal attention. Furthermore, we stack the 2D latents from MDSA into a unified 3D latent space, which is processed by a spatio-temporal diffusion Transformer. This design efficiently models spatiotemporal dependencies, enabling the generation of high-fidelity synchronized audio-video content while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ProAV-DiT outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency.",human
"The rise of graph-structured data has driven major advances in Graph Machine Learning (GML), where graph embeddings (GEs) map features from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into vector spaces, enabling tasks like node classification and link prediction. However, since GEs are derived from explicit topology and features, they may miss crucial implicit knowledge hidden in seemingly sparse datasets, affecting graph structure and their representation. We propose a GML pipeline that integrates a Knowledge Completion (KC) phase to uncover latent dataset semantics before embedding generation. Focusing on transitive relations, we model hidden connections with decay-based inference functions, reshaping graph topology, with consequences on embedding dynamics and aggregation processes in GraphSAGE and Node2Vec. Experiments show that our GML pipeline significantly alters the embedding space geometry, demonstrating that its introduction is not just a simple enrichment but a transformative step that redefines graph representation quality.",human
"Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with finite-sample coverage. Yet, efficiently leveraging multiple conformity scores to reduce prediction set size remains a major open challenge. Instead of selecting a single best score, this work introduces a principled aggregation strategy, COnfidence-Level Allocation (COLA), that optimally allocates confidence levels across multiple conformal prediction sets to minimize empirical set size while maintaining provable coverage. Two variants are further developed, COLA-s and COLA-f, which guarantee finite-sample marginal coverage via sample splitting and full conformalization, respectively. In addition, we develop COLA-l, an individualized allocation strategy that promotes local size efficiency while achieving asymptotic conditional coverage. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that COLA achieves considerably smaller prediction sets than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining valid coverage.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled self-improving AI, i.e., AI that iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines its own outcomes. Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement. We also empirically validate T-BoN BO by applying it to automated ad alignment tasks for persona distribution, demonstrating its superior performance compared to popular state-of-the-art baselines.",human
"Trajectory similarity computation is fundamental functionality that is used for, e.g., clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%.",human
"The advent of smart manufacturing is addressing the limitations of traditional centralized scheduling and inflexible production line configurations in the rubber tyre industry, especially in terms of coping with dynamic production demands. Contemporary tyre manufacturing systems form complex networks of tightly coupled subsystems pronounced nonlinear interactions and emergent dynamics. This complexity renders the effective coordination of multiple subsystems, posing an essential yet formidable task. For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO). This algorithm employs a multi-branch policy architecture with differentiated gradient clipping constraints to ensure stable and efficient high-dimensional policy updates. Validated through experiments on width and thickness control in rubber tyre film production, MPD-PPO demonstrates substantial improvements in both tuning accuracy and operational efficiency. The framework successfully tackles key challenges, including high dimensionality, multi-objective trade-offs, and dynamic adaptation, thus delivering enhanced performance and production stability for real-time industrial deployment in tyre manufacturing.",human
"Video generation has been advancing rapidly, and diffusion transformer (DiT) based models have demonstrated remark- able capabilities. However, their practical deployment is of- ten hindered by slow inference speeds and high memory con- sumption. In this paper, we propose a novel pipelining frame- work named PipeDiT to accelerate video generation, which is equipped with three main innovations. First, we design a pipelining algorithm (PipeSP) for sequence parallelism (SP) to enable the computation of latent generation and commu- nication among multiple GPUs to be pipelined, thus reduc- ing inference latency. Second, we propose DeDiVAE to de- couple the diffusion module and the variational autoencoder (VAE) module into two GPU groups, whose executions can also be pipelined to reduce memory consumption and infer- ence latency. Third, to better utilize the GPU resources in the VAE group, we propose an attention co-processing (Aco) method to further reduce the overall video generation latency. We integrate our PipeDiT into both OpenSoraPlan and Hun- yuanVideo, two state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks, and conduct extensive experiments on two 8- GPU systems. Experimental results show that, under many common resolution and timestep configurations, our PipeDiT achieves 1.06x to 4.02x speedups over OpenSoraPlan and HunyuanVideo.",human
"Steganography and steganalysis are strongly related subjects of information security. Over the past decade, many powerful and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) - driven techniques have been designed and presented during research into steganography as well as steganalysis. This study presents a scientometric analysis of AI-driven steganography-based data hiding techniques using a thematic modelling approach. A total of 654 articles within the time span of 2017 to 2023 have been considered. Experimental evaluation of the study reveals that 69% of published articles are from Asian countries. The China is on top (TP:312), followed by India (TP-114). The study mainly identifies seven thematic clusters: steganographic image data hiding, deep image steganalysis, neural watermark robustness, linguistic steganography models, speech steganalysis algorithms, covert communication networks, and video steganography techniques. The proposed study also assesses the scope of AI-steganography under the purview of sustainable development goals (SDGs) to present the interdisciplinary reciprocity between them. It has been observed that only 18 of the 654 articles are aligned with one of the SDGs, which shows that limited studies conducted in alignment with SDG goals. SDG9 which is Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure is leading among 18 SDGs mapped articles. To the top of our insight, this study is the unique one to present a scientometric study on AI-driven steganography-based data hiding techniques. In the context of descriptive statistics, the study breaks down the underlying causes of observed trends, including the influence of DL developments, trends in East Asia and maturity of foundational methods. The work also stresses upon the critical gaps in societal alignment, particularly the SDGs, ultimately working on unveiling the field's global impact on AI security challenges.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can subtly manipulate their outputs. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, many operate as black boxes, lacking transparency in their decision-making. This paper introduces ExplainableGuard, an interpretable adversarial defense framework leveraging the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Reasoner. Our approach not only detects and neutralizes adversarial perturbations in text but also provides step-by-step explanations for each defense action. We demonstrate how tailored CoT prompts guide the LLM to perform a multi-faceted analysis (character, word, structural, and semantic) and generate a purified output along with a human-readable justification. Preliminary results on the GLUE Benchmark and IMDB Movie Reviews dataset show promising defense efficacy. Additionally, a human evaluation study reveals that ExplainableGuard's explanations outperform ablated variants in clarity, specificity, and actionability, with a 72.5% deployability-trust rating, underscoring its potential for more trustworthy LLM deployments.",human
"Medical images exhibit latent anatomical groupings, such as organs, tissues, and pathological regions, that standard Vision Transformers (ViTs) fail to exploit. While recent work like SBM-Transformer attempts to incorporate such structures through stochastic binary masking, they suffer from non-differentiability, training instability, and the inability to model complex community structure. We present DCMM-Transformer, a novel ViT architecture for medical image analysis that incorporates a Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership (DCMM) model as an additive bias in self-attention. Unlike prior approaches that rely on multiplicative masking and binary sampling, our method introduces community structure and degree heterogeneity in a fully differentiable and interpretable manner. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets, including brain, chest, breast, and ocular modalities, demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the learned group structure and structured attention modulation substantially enhance interpretability by yielding attention maps that are anatomically meaningful and semantically coherent.",human
"Knowledge Distillation (KD) is essential for compressing large models, yet relying on pre-trained ""teacher"" models downloaded from third-party repositories introduces serious security risks -- most notably backdoor attacks. Existing KD backdoor methods are typically complex and computationally intensive: they employ surrogate student models and simulated distillation to guarantee transferability, and they construct triggers in a way similar to universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), which being not stealthy in magnitude, inherently exhibit strong adversarial behavior. This work questions whether such complexity is necessary and constructs stealthy ""weak"" triggers -- imperceptible perturbations that have negligible adversarial effect. We propose BackWeak, a simple, surrogate-free attack paradigm. BackWeak shows that a powerful backdoor can be implanted by simply fine-tuning a benign teacher with a weak trigger using a very small learning rate. We demonstrate that this delicate fine-tuning is sufficient to embed a backdoor that reliably transfers to diverse student architectures during a victim's standard distillation process, yielding high attack success rates. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, model architectures, and KD methods show that BackWeak is efficient, simpler, and often more stealthy than previous elaborate approaches. This work calls on researchers studying KD backdoor attacks to pay particular attention to the trigger's stealthiness and its potential adversarial characteristics.",human
"Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.",human
"Super-resolution flow reconstruction using state-of-the-art data-driven techniques is valuable for a variety of applications, such as subgrid/subfilter closure modeling, accelerating spatiotemporal forecasting, data compression, and serving as an upscaling tool for sparse experimental measurements. In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element + neighborhood graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.",human
"We apply preference learning to the task of language model-guided design of novel structural alloys. In contrast to prior work that focuses on generating stable inorganic crystals, our approach targets the synthesizeability of a specific structural class: BCC/B2 superalloys, an underexplored family of materials with potential applications in extreme environments. Using three open-weight models (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and OLMo-2), we demonstrate that language models can be optimized for multiple design objectives using a single, unified reward signal through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or human-in-the-loop feedback (costly), our reward signal is derived from thermodynamic phase calculations, offering a scientifically grounded criterion for model tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of preference-tuning a language model using physics-grounded feedback for structural alloy design. The resulting framework is general and extensible, providing a path forward for intelligent design-space exploration across a range of physical science domains.",human
"Multimodal representation learning harmonizes distinct modalities by aligning them into a unified latent space. Recent research generalizes traditional cross-modal alignment to produce enhanced multimodal synergy but requires all modalities to be present for a common instance, making it challenging to utilize prevalent datasets with missing modalities. We provide theoretical insights into this issue from an anchor shift perspective. Observed modalities are aligned with a local anchor that deviates from the optimal one when all modalities are present, resulting in an inevitable shift. To address this, we propose CalMRL for multimodal representation learning to calibrate incomplete alignments caused by missing modalities. Specifically, CalMRL leverages the priors and the inherent connections among modalities to model the imputation for the missing ones at the representation level. To resolve the optimization dilemma, we employ a bi-step learning method with the closed-form solution of the posterior distribution of shared latents. We validate its mitigation of anchor shift and convergence with theoretical guidance. By equipping the calibrated alignment with the existing advanced method, we offer new flexibility to absorb data with missing modalities, which is originally unattainable. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate the superiority of CalMRL. Our code, model checkpoints, and evaluation raw data will be publicly available.",human
"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in hardware design automation, particularly in using natural language to synthesize Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code. Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and naïvely spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability. These results indicate that focusing RL on critical, high-uncertainty tokens enables more reliable and targeted policy improvement for structured RTL code generation.",human
"With the skyrocketing costs of GPUs and their virtual instances in the cloud, there is a significant desire to use CPUs for large language model (LLM) inference. KV cache update, often implemented as allocation, copying, and in-place strided update for each generated token, incurs significant overhead. As the sequence length increases, the allocation and copy overheads dominate the performance. Alternate approaches may allocate large KV tensors upfront to enable in-place updates, but these matrices (with zero-padded rows) cause redundant computations. In this work, we propose a new KV cache allocation mechanism called Balancing Memory and Compute (BMC). BMC allocates, once every r iterations, KV tensors with r redundant rows, allowing in-place update without copy overhead for those iterations, but at the expense of a small amount of redundant computation. Second, we make an interesting observation that the extra rows allocated in the KV tensors and the resulting redundant computation can be repurposed for Speculative Decoding (SD) that improves token generation efficiency. Last, BMC represents a spectrum of design points with different values of r. To identify the best-performing design point(s), we derive a simple analytical model for BMC. The proposed BMC method achieves an average throughput acceleration of up to 3.2x over baseline HuggingFace (without SD). Importantly when we apply BMC with SD, it results in an additional speedup of up to 1.39x, over and above the speedup offered by SD. Further, BMC achieves a throughput acceleration of up to 1.36x and 2.29x over state-of-the-art inference servers vLLM and DeepSpeed, respectively. Although the BMC technique is evaluated extensively across different classes of CPUs (desktop and server class), we also evaluate the scheme with GPUs and demonstrate that it works well for GPUs.",human
"Quantifying numerical data involves addressing two key challenges: first, determining whether the data can be naturally quantified, and second, identifying the numerical intervals or ranges of values that correspond to specific value classes, referred to as ""quantums,"" which represent statistically meaningful states. If such quantification is feasible, continuous streams of numerical data can be transformed into sequences of ""symbols"" that reflect the states of the system described by the measured parameter. People often perform this task intuitively, relying on common sense or practical experience, while information theory and computer science offer computable metrics for this purpose. In this study, we assess the applicability of metrics based on information compression and the Silhouette coefficient for quantifying numerical data. We also investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with one another and with what is commonly referred to as ""human intuition."" Our findings suggest that the ability to classify numeric data values into distinct categories is associated with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5; otherwise, the data can be treated as following a unimodal normal distribution. Furthermore, when quantification is possible, the Silhouette coefficient appears to align more closely with human intuition than the ""normalized centroid distance"" method derived from information compression perspective.",human
"Long-video understanding remains a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to inherent token limitations and the complexity of capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Existing methods often fail to capture the global context and complex event relationships necessary for deep video reasoning. To address this, we introduce GCAgent, a novel Global-Context-Aware Agent framework that achieves comprehensive long-video understanding. Our core innovation is the Schematic and Narrative Episodic Memory. This memory structurally models events and their causal and temporal relations into a concise, organized context, fundamentally resolving the long-term dependency problem. Operating in a multi-stage Perception-Action-Reflection cycle, our GCAgent utilizes a Memory Manager to retrieve relevant episodic context for robust, context-aware inference. Extensive experiments confirm that GCAgent significantly enhances long-video understanding, achieving up to 23.5\% accuracy improvement on the Video-MME Long split over a strong MLLM baseline. Furthermore, our framework establishes state-of-the-art performance among comparable 7B-scale MLLMs, achieving 73.4\% accuracy on the Long split and the highest overall average (71.9\%) on the Video-MME benchmark, validating our agent-based reasoning paradigm and structured memory for cognitively-inspired long-video understanding.",human
"Traffic safety analysis at signalized intersections is vital for reducing vehicle and pedestrian collisions, yet traditional crash-based studies are limited by data sparsity and latency. This paper presents a novel multi-camera computer vision framework for real-time safety assessment through Post-Encroachment Time (PET) computation, demonstrated at the intersection of H Street and Broadway in Chula Vista, California. Four synchronized cameras provide continuous visual coverage, with each frame processed on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier devices using YOLOv11 segmentation for vehicle detection. Detected vehicle polygons are transformed into a unified bird's-eye map using homography matrices, enabling alignment across overlapping camera views. A novel pixel-level PET algorithm measures vehicle position without reliance on fixed cells, allowing fine-grained hazard visualization via dynamic heatmaps, accurate to 3.3 sq-cm. Timestamped vehicle and PET data is stored in an SQL database for long-term monitoring. Results over various time intervals demonstrate the framework's ability to identify high-risk regions with sub-second precision and real-time throughput on edge devices, producing data for an 800 x 800 pixel logarithmic heatmap at an average of 2.68 FPS. This study validates the feasibility of decentralized vision-based PET analysis for intelligent transportation systems, offering a replicable methodology for high-resolution, real-time, and scalable intersection safety evaluation.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in culturally diverse environments, yet existing evaluations of cultural competence remain limited. Existing methods focus on de-contextualized correctness or forced-choice judgments, overlooking the need for cultural understanding and reasoning required for appropriate responses. To address this gap, we introduce a set of benchmarks that, instead of directly probing abstract norms or isolated statements, present models with realistic situational contexts that require culturally grounded reasoning. In addition to the standard Exact Match metric, we introduce four complementary metrics (Coverage, Specificity, Connotation, and Coherence) to capture different dimensions of model's response quality. Empirical analysis across frontier models reveals that thin evaluation systematically overestimates cultural competence and produces unstable assessments with high variance. In contrast, thick evaluation exposes differences in reasoning depth, reduces variance, and provides more stable, interpretable signals of cultural understanding.",human
"We present a large-scale analysis of career mobility of college-educated U.S. workers using online resume profiles to investigate how gender, race, and job change options are associated with upward mobility. This study addresses key research questions of how the job changes affect their upward career mobility, and how the outcomes of upward career mobility differ by gender and race. We address data challenges -- such as missing demographic attributes, missing wage data, and noisy occupation labels -- through various data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. In particular, we develop a large language models (LLMs) based occupation classification method known as FewSOC that achieves accuracy significantly higher than the original occupation labels in the resume dataset. Analysis of 228,710 career trajectories reveals that intra-firm occupation change has been found to facilitate upward mobility most strongly, followed by inter-firm occupation change and inter-firm lateral move. Women and Black college graduates experience significantly lower returns from job changes than men and White peers. Multilevel sensitivity analyses confirm that these disparities are robust to cluster-level heterogeneity and reveal additional intersectional patterns.",human
"Recent advances in text-to-image generation have produced strong single-shot models, yet no individual system reliably executes the long, compositional prompts typical of creative workflows. We introduce Image-POSER, a reflective reinforcement learning framework that (i) orchestrates a diverse registry of pretrained text-to-image and image-to-image experts, (ii) handles long-form prompts end-to-end through dynamic task decomposition, and (iii) supervises alignment at each step via structured feedback from a vision-language model critic. By casting image synthesis and editing as a Markov Decision Process, we learn non-trivial expert pipelines that adaptively combine strengths across models. Experiments show that Image-POSER outperforms baselines, including frontier models, across industry-standard and custom benchmarks in alignment, fidelity, and aesthetics, and is consistently preferred in human evaluations. These results highlight that reinforcement learning can endow AI systems with the capacity to autonomously decompose, reorder, and combine visual models, moving towards general-purpose visual assistants.",human
"AI tools in pathology have improved screening throughput, standardized quantification, and revealed prognostic patterns that inform treatment. However, adoption remains limited because most systems still lack the human-readable reasoning needed to audit decisions and prevent errors. We present RECAP-PATH, an interpretable framework that establishes a self-learning paradigm, shifting off-the-shelf multimodal large language models from passive pattern recognition to evidence-linked diagnostic reasoning. At its core is a two-phase learning process that autonomously derives diagnostic criteria: diversification expands pathology-style explanations, while optimization refines them for accuracy. This self-learning approach requires only small labeled sets and no white-box access or weight updates to generate cancer diagnoses. Evaluated on breast and prostate datasets, RECAP-PATH produced rationales aligned with expert assessment and delivered substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy over baselines. By uniting visual understanding with reasoning, RECAP-PATH provides clinically trustworthy AI and demonstrates a generalizable path toward evidence-linked interpretation.",human
"Deep learning is transforming microscopy, yet models often fail when applied to images from new instruments or acquisition settings. Conventional adversarial domain adaptation (ADDA) retrains entire networks, often disrupting learned semantic representations. Here, we overturn this paradigm by showing that adapting only the earliest convolutional layers, while freezing deeper layers, yields reliable transfer. Building on this principle, we introduce Subnetwork Image Translation ADDA with automatic depth selection (SIT-ADDA-Auto), a self-configuring framework that integrates shallow-layer adversarial alignment with predictive uncertainty to automatically select adaptation depth without target labels. We demonstrate robustness via multi-metric evaluation, blinded expert assessment, and uncertainty-depth ablations. Across exposure and illumination shifts, cross-instrument transfer, and multiple stains, SIT-ADDA improves reconstruction and downstream segmentation over full-encoder adaptation and non-adversarial baselines, with reduced drift of semantic features. Our results provide a design rule for label-free adaptation in microscopy and a recipe for field settings; the code is publicly available.",human
"Aiming to identify precise evidence sources from visual documents, visual evidence attribution for visual document retrieval-augmented generation (VD-RAG) ensures reliable and verifiable predictions from vision-language models (VLMs) in multimodal question answering. Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains.",human
"A challenge in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models for specific topics is to select good examples. Fine-tuning from image sets of varying quality, such as Wikipedia Commons, will often produce poor output. However, training images that \textit{do} exemplify the target concept (e.g., a \textit{female Mountain Bluebird}) help ensure that the generated images are similarly representative (e.g., have the prototypical blue-wings and gray chest). In this work, we propose QZLoRA, a framework to select images for low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The approach leverages QuizRank, a method to automatically rank images by treating them as an `educational intervention' and `quizzing' a VLM. We demonstrate that QZLoRA can produce better aligned, photorealistic images with fewer samples. We also show that these fine-tuned models can produce stylized that are similarly representative (i.e., illustrations). Our results highlight the promise of combining automated visual reasoning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for topic-adaptive generative modeling.",human
"Explanations are often promoted as tools for transparency, but they can also foster confirmation bias; users may assume reasoning is correct whenever outputs appear acceptable. We study this double-edged role of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations in multimodal moral scenarios by systematically perturbing reasoning chains and manipulating delivery tones. Specifically, we analyze reasoning errors in vision language models (VLMs) and how they impact user trust and the ability to detect errors. Our findings reveal two key effects: (1) users often equate trust with outcome agreement, sustaining reliance even when reasoning is flawed, and (2) the confident tone suppresses error detection while maintaining reliance, showing that delivery styles can override correctness. These results highlight how CoT explanations can simultaneously clarify and mislead, underscoring the need for NLP systems to provide explanations that encourage scrutiny and critical thinking rather than blind trust. All code will be released publicly.",human
"Despite their wide application, the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks raise societal concerns. Among them, transformation-based attacks have demonstrated notable success in transfer attacks. However, existing attacks suffer from blind spots in parameter optimization, limiting their full potential. Specifically, (1) prior work generally considers low-iteration settings, yet attacks perform quite differently at higher iterations, so characterizing overall performance based only on low-iteration results is misleading. (2) Existing attacks use uniform parameters for different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks, which greatly impairs transferability. (3) Traditional transformation parameter optimization relies on grid search. For n parameters with m steps each, the complexity is O(mn). Large computational overhead limits further optimization of parameters. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study with various transformations as baselines, revealing three dynamic patterns of transferability with respect to parameter strength. We further propose a novel Concentric Decay Model (CDM) to effectively explain these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose an efficient Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) based on the rise-then-fall pattern, reducing the complexity to O(nlogm). Comprehensive experiments on existing transformation-based attacks across different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks demonstrate that our DPO can significantly improve transferability.",human
"Connected and autonomous vehicles across land, water, and air must often operate in dynamic, unpredictable environments with limited communication, no centralized control, and partial observability. These real-world constraints pose significant challenges for coordination, particularly when vehicles pursue individual objectives. To address this, we propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that enables vehicles, acting as agents, to communicate selectively based on local goals and observations. This goal-aware communication strategy allows agents to share only relevant information, enhancing collaboration while respecting visibility limitations. We validate our approach in complex multi-agent navigation tasks featuring obstacles and dynamic agent populations. Results show that our method significantly improves task success rates and reduces time-to-goal compared to non-cooperative baselines. Moreover, task performance remains stable as the number of agents increases, demonstrating scalability. These findings highlight the potential of decentralized, goal-driven MARL to support effective coordination in realistic multi-vehicle systems operating across diverse domains.",human
"Time series forecasting is crucial for applications in various domains. Conventional methods often rely on global decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which become ineffective for real-world series dominated by local, complex, and highly dynamic patterns. Moreover, the high model complexity of such approaches limits their applicability in real-time or resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a novel \textbf{RE}liability-aware \textbf{C}odebook-\textbf{AS}sisted \textbf{T}ime series forecasting framework (\textbf{ReCast}) that enables lightweight and robust prediction by exploiting recurring local shapes. ReCast encodes local patterns into discrete embeddings through patch-wise quantization using a learnable codebook, thereby compactly capturing stable regular structures. To compensate for residual variations not preserved by quantization, ReCast employs a dual-path architecture comprising a quantization path for efficient modeling of regular structures and a residual path for reconstructing irregular fluctuations. A central contribution of ReCast is a reliability-aware codebook update strategy, which incrementally refines the codebook via weighted corrections. These correction weights are derived by fusing multiple reliability factors from complementary perspectives by a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme, ensuring adaptability to non-stationarity and robustness to distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCast outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to distribution shifts.",human
"The convergence of deep learning and formal mathematics has spurred research in formal verification. Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods.",human
"Modern epidemiological analytics increasingly use machine learning models that offer strong prediction but often lack calibrated uncertainty. Bayesian methods provide principled uncertainty quantification, yet are viewed as difficult to integrate with contemporary AI workflows. This paper proposes a unified Bayesian and AI framework that combines Bayesian prediction with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.   We use Bayesian logistic regression to obtain calibrated individual-level disease risk and credible intervals on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. In parallel, we use Gaussian-process Bayesian optimization to tune penalized Cox survival models on the GBSG2 breast cancer cohort. This yields a two-layer system: a Bayesian predictive layer that represents risk as a posterior distribution, and a Bayesian optimization layer that treats model selection as inference over a black-box objective.   Simulation studies in low- and high-dimensional regimes show that the Bayesian layer provides reliable coverage and improved calibration, while Bayesian shrinkage improves AUC, Brier score, and log-loss. Bayesian optimization consistently pushes survival models toward near-oracle concordance. Overall, Bayesian reasoning enhances both what we infer and how we search, enabling calibrated risk and principled hyperparameter intelligence for epidemiological decision making.",human
"Generative LLMs typically improve Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance through instruction tuning. They excel at generating entities by semantic pattern matching but lack an explicit, verifiable reasoning mechanism. This ""cognitive shortcutting"" leads to suboptimal performance and brittle generalization, especially in zero-shot and lowresource scenarios where reasoning from limited contextual cues is crucial. To address this issue, a reasoning framework is proposed for NER, which shifts the extraction paradigm from implicit pattern matching to explicit reasoning. This framework consists of three stages: Chain of Thought (CoT) generation, CoT tuning, and reasoning enhancement. First, a dataset annotated with NER-oriented CoTs is generated, which contain task-relevant reasoning chains. Then, they are used to tune the NER model to generate coherent rationales before deriving the final answer. Finally, a reasoning enhancement stage is implemented to optimize the reasoning process using a comprehensive reward signal. This stage ensures explicit and verifiable extractions. Experiments show that ReasoningNER demonstrates impressive cognitive ability in the NER task, achieving competitive performance. In zero-shot settings, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming GPT-4 by 12.3 percentage points on the F1 score. Analytical results also demonstrate its great potential to advance research in reasoningoriented information extraction. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HuiResearch/ReasoningIE.",human
"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from fixed datasets without further environment interaction, making it particularly valuable in high-risk or costly domains. Extreme $Q$-Learning (XQL) is a recent offline RL method that models Bellman errors using the Extreme Value Theorem, yielding strong empirical performance. However, XQL and its stabilized variant MXQL suffer from notable limitations: both require extensive hyperparameter tuning specific to each dataset and domain, and also exhibit instability during training. To address these issues, we proposed a principled method to estimate the temperature coefficient $β$ via quantile regression under mild assumptions. To further improve training stability, we introduce a value regularization technique with mild generalization, inspired by recent advances in constrained value learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of benchmark tasks, including D4RL and NeoRL2, while maintaining stable training dynamics and using a consistent set of hyperparameters across all datasets and domains.",human
"We study the problem of entropy calibration, which asks whether a language model's entropy over generations matches its log loss on human text. Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text.",human
"Tracking body fat percentage is essential for effective weight management, yet gold-standard methods such as DEXA scans remain expensive and inaccessible for most people. This study evaluates the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) models as low-cost alternatives using frontal body images and basic anthropometric data. The dataset consists of 535 samples: 253 cases with recorded anthropometric measurements (weight, height, neck, ankle, and wrist) and 282 images obtained via web scraping from Reddit posts with self-reported body fat percentages, including some reported as DEXA-derived by the original posters. Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted models can offer accessible and low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer applications in health and fitness.",human
"This study introduces a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that achieves deterministic detection of statutory inconsistency in complex law. We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.   LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.   This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.   In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection.",human
"In this paper, we propose a new Temporal MDS-Vision Transformer (T-MDS-ViT) for multiclass target classification using millimeter-wave FMCW radar micro-Doppler spectrograms. Specifically, we design a transformer-based architecture that processes stacked range-velocity-angle (RVA) spatiotemporal tensors via patch embeddings and cross-axis attention mechanisms to explicitly model the sequential nature of MDS data across multiple frames. The T-MDS-ViT exploits mobility-aware constraints in its attention layer correspondences to maintain separability under target overlaps and partial occlusions. Next, we apply an explainable mechanism to examine how the attention layers focus on characteristic high-energy regions of the MDS representations and their effect on class-specific kinematic features. We also demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to existing CNN-based methods in terms of classification accuracy while achieving better data efficiency and real-time deployability.",human
"Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful paradigm for distributed learning, but its increasing complexity leads to significant energy consumption from client-side computations for training models. In particular, the challenge is critical in energy-harvesting FL (EHFL) systems where participation availability of each device oscillates due to limited energy. To address this, we propose FedBacys, a battery-aware EHFL framework using cyclic client participation based on users' battery levels. By clustering clients and scheduling them sequentially, FedBacys minimizes redundant computations, reduces system-wide energy usage, and improves learning stability. We also introduce FedBacys-Odd, a more energy-efficient variant that allows clients to participate selectively, further reducing energy costs without compromising performance. We provide a convergence analysis for our framework and demonstrate its superior energy efficiency and robustness compared to existing algorithms through numerical experiments.",human
"In this paper, we propose the concept of AIO-RAN-NTN, a unified all-in-one Radio Access Network (RAN) for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), built on an open architecture that leverages open interfaces and artificial intelligence (AI)-based functionalities. This approach advances interoperability, flexibility, and intelligence in next-generation telecommunications. First, we provide a concise overview of the state-of-the-art architectures for Open-RAN and AI-RAN, highlighting key network functions and infrastructure elements. Next, we introduce our integrated AIO-RAN-NTN blueprint, emphasizing how internal and air interfaces from AIO-RAN and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) can be applied to emerging environments such as NTNs. To examine the impact of mobility on AIO-RAN, we implement a testbed transmission using the OpenAirInterface platform for a standalone (SA) New Radio (NR) 5G system. We then train an AI model on realistic data to forecast key performance indicators (KPIs). Our experiments demonstrate that the AIO-based SA architecture is sensitive to mobility, even at low speeds, but this limitation can be mitigated through AI-driven KPI forecasting.",human
"Knowledge graph-based dialogue generation (KG-DG) is a challenging task requiring models to effectively incorporate external knowledge into conversational responses. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various NLP tasks, their ability to utilize external knowledge in KG-DG remains under-explored. We observe that LLMs often rely on internal knowledge, leading to detachment from provided knowledge graphs, even when they are given a flawlessly retrieved knowledge graph. First, we introduce LLM-KAT, an evaluation procedure for measuring knowledge attachment in generated responses. Second, we propose a simple yet effective entity anonymization technique to encourage LLMs to better leverage external knowledge. Experiments on the OpenDialKG dataset demonstrate that our approach improves LLMs' attachment on external knowledge.",human
"In recent years, humanity has begun to experience the catastrophic effects of climate change as economic sectors (such as agriculture) struggle with unpredictable and extreme weather events. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of ""climate outlier events"". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios). The focal climate-change domain used relies on predicting grass growth on Irish dairy farms, during Europe-wide drought and forage crisis of 2018.",human
"Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising approach for learning electroencephalography (EEG) representations from unlabeled data, reducing the need for expensive annotations for clinical applications like sleep staging and seizure detection. While current EEG SSL methods predominantly use masked reconstruction strategies like masked autoencoders (MAE) that capture local temporal patterns, position prediction pretraining remains underexplored despite its potential to learn long-range dependencies in neural signals. We introduce PAirwise Relative Shift or PARS pretraining, a novel pretext task that predicts relative temporal shifts between randomly sampled EEG window pairs. Unlike reconstruction-based methods that focus on local pattern recovery, PARS encourages encoders to capture relative temporal composition and long-range dependencies inherent in neural signals. Through comprehensive evaluation on various EEG decoding tasks, we demonstrate that PARS-pretrained transformers consistently outperform existing pretraining strategies in label-efficient and transfer learning settings, establishing a new paradigm for self-supervised EEG representation learning.",human
"Precise neutrino energy reconstruction is essential for next-generation long-baseline oscillation experiments, yet current methods remain limited by large uncertainties in neutrino-nucleus interaction modeling. Even so, it is well established that different interaction channels produce systematically varying amounts of missing energy and therefore yield different reconstruction performance--information that standard calorimetric approaches do not exploit. We introduce a strategy that incorporates this structure by classifying events according to their underlying interaction type prior to energy reconstruction. Using supervised machine-learning techniques trained on labeled generator events, we leverage intrinsic kinematic differences among quasi-elastic scattering, meson-exchange current, resonance production, and deep-inelastic scattering processes. A cross-generator testing framework demonstrates that this classification approach is robust to microphysics mismodeling and, when applied to a simulated DUNE $ν_μ$ disappearance analysis, yields improved accuracy and sensitivity. These results highlight a practical path toward reducing reconstruction-driven systematics in future oscillation measurements.",human
"Ultrasound-based risk stratification of thyroid nodules is a critical clinical task, but it suffers from high inter-observer variability. While many deep learning (DL) models function as ""black boxes,"" we propose a fully automated, two-stage framework for interpretable malignancy prediction. Our method achieves interpretability by forcing the model to focus only on clinically relevant regions. First, a TransUNet model automatically segments the thyroid nodule. The resulting mask is then used to create a region of interest around the nodule, and this localised image is fed directly into a ResNet-18 classifier. We evaluated our framework using 5-fold cross-validation on a clinical dataset of 349 images, where it achieved a high F1-score of 0.852 for predicting malignancy. To validate its performance, we compared it against a strong baseline using a Random Forest classifier with hand-crafted morphological features, which achieved an F1-score of 0.829. The superior performance of our DL framework suggests that the implicit visual features learned from the localised nodule are more predictive than explicit shape features alone. This is the first fully automated end-to-end pipeline for both detecting thyroid nodules on ultrasound images and predicting their malignancy.",human
"Electronic health record (EHR) data present tremendous opportunities for advancing survival analysis through deep learning, yet reproducibility remains severely constrained by inconsistent preprocessing methodologies. We present SurvBench, a comprehensive, open-source preprocessing pipeline that transforms raw PhysioNet datasets into standardised, model-ready tensors for multi-modal survival analysis. SurvBench provides data loaders for three major critical care databases, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and MC-MED, supporting diverse modalities including time-series vitals, static demographics, ICD diagnosis codes, and radiology reports. The pipeline implements rigorous data quality controls, patient-level splitting to prevent data leakage, explicit missingness tracking, and standardised temporal aggregation. SurvBench handles both single-risk (e.g., in-hospital mortality) and competing-risks scenarios (e.g., multiple discharge outcomes). The outputs are compatible with pycox library packages and implementations of standard statistical and deep learning models. By providing reproducible, configuration-driven preprocessing with comprehensive documentation, SurvBench addresses the ""preprocessing gap"" that has hindered fair comparison of deep learning survival models, enabling researchers to focus on methodological innovation rather than data engineering.",human
"We present a systematic comparison of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods across CLIP-stratified regimes using AURC and AUGRC as primary metrics. Experiments cover two representation paradigms: CNNs trained from scratch and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT), evaluated on CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection. Under stronger shifts, geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) prevail on CNNs, whereas on ViTs GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. We further show a class-count-dependent trade-off for Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD) and that a simple PCA projection improves several detectors. These results support a representation-centric view of OOD detection and provide statistically grounded guidance for method selection under distribution shift.",human
"Large language model agents for data analysis typically generate and execute code directly on databases. However, when applied to sensitive data, this approach poses significant security risks. To address this issue, we propose a security-motivated alternative: restrict LLMs from direct code generation and data access, and require them to interact with data exclusively through a predefined set of secure, verified tools. Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis. To reduce this gap, we introduce Indirect Data Engagement (InData), a dataset designed to assess LLMs' multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. InData includes data analysis questions at three difficulty levels--Easy, Medium, and Hard--capturing increasing reasoning complexity. We benchmark 15 open-source LLMs on InData and find that while large models (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) achieve high accuracy on Easy tasks (97.3%), performance drops sharply on Hard tasks (69.6%). These results show that current LLMs still lack robust multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. With InData, we take a step toward enabling the development and evaluation of LLMs with stronger multi-step tool-use capabilities. We will publicly release the dataset and code.",human
"In Extended Reality (XR), rendering sound that accurately simulates real-world acoustics is pivotal in creating lifelike and believable virtual experiences. However, existing XR spatial audio rendering methods often struggle with real-time adaptation to diverse physical scenes, causing a sensory mismatch between visual and auditory cues that disrupts user immersion. To address this, we introduce SAMOSA, a novel on-device system that renders spatially accurate sound by dynamically adapting to its physical environment. SAMOSA leverages a synergistic multimodal scene representation by fusing real-time estimations of room geometry, surface materials, and semantic-driven acoustic context. This rich representation then enables efficient acoustic calibration via scene priors, allowing the system to synthesize a highly realistic Room Impulse Response (RIR). We validate our system through technical evaluation using acoustic metrics for RIR synthesis across various room configurations and sound types, alongside an expert evaluation (N=12). Evaluation results demonstrate SAMOSA's feasibility and efficacy in enhancing XR auditory realism.",human
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are fundamental tools in graph machine learning. The performance of GNNs relies crucially on the availability of informative node features, which can be limited or absent in real-life datasets and applications. A natural remedy is to augment the node features with embeddings computed from eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. While it is natural to default to Laplacian spectral embeddings, which capture meaningful graph connectivity information, we ask whether spectral embeddings from alternative graph matrices can also provide useful representations for learning. We introduce Interpolated Laplacian Embeddings (ILEs), which are derived from a simple yet expressive family of graph matrices. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we offer a straightforward interpretation of the structural information that ILEs capture. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments on real-world datasets that feature augmentation via ILEs can improve performance across commonly used GNN architectures. Our work offers a straightforward and practical approach that broadens the practitioner's spectral augmentation toolkit when node features are limited.",human
"We study the high-dimensional inference of a rank-one signal corrupted by sparse noise. The noise is modelled as the adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph with finite average connectivity in the large size limit. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we analytically compute the typical value of the top eigenvalue, the top eigenvector component density, and the overlap between the signal vector and the top eigenvector. The solution is given in terms of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. Specialising the noise matrix to Poissonian and Random Regular degree distributions, the critical signal strength is analytically identified at which a transition happens for the recovery of the signal via the top eigenvector, thus generalising the celebrated BBP transition to the sparse noise case. In the large-connectivity limit, known results for dense noise are recovered. Analytical results are in agreement with numerical diagonalisation of large matrices.",human
"This paper introduces the ``rebound Winner-Take-All (RWTA)"" motif as the basic element of a scalable neuromorphic control architecture. From the cellular level to the system level, the resulting architecture combines the reliability of discrete computation and the tunability of continuous regulation: it inherits the discrete computation capabilities of winner-take-all state machines and the continuous tuning capabilities of excitable biophysical circuits. The proposed event-based framework addresses continuous rhythmic generation and discrete decision-making in a unified physical modeling language.

"Large Language Models have advanced clinical text classification, but their opaque predictions remain a critical barrier to practical adoption in research and clinical settings where investigators and physicians need to understand which parts of a patient's record drive risk signals. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CALM}, short for \textbf{Classification with Additive Large Language Models}, an interpretable framework for semi-structured text where inputs are composed of semantically meaningful components, such as sections of an admission note or question-answer fields from an intake form. CALM predicts outcomes as the additive sum of each component's contribution, making these contributions part of the forward computation itself and enabling faithful explanations at both the patient and population level. The additive structure also enables clear visualizations, such as component-level risk curves similar to those used in generalized additive models, making the learned relationships easier to inspect and communicate. Although CALM expects semi-structured inputs, many clinical documents already have this form, and similar structure can often be automatically extracted from free-text notes. CALM achieves performance comparable to conventional LLM classifiers while improving trust, supporting quality-assurance checks, and revealing clinically meaningful patterns during model development and auditing.",human
"We study a deliberately simple, fully non-linguistic model of text: a sequence of independent draws from a finite alphabet of letters plus a single space symbol. A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability.   Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models. The results show that Zipf-like patterns can arise purely from combinatorics and segmentation, without optimization principles or linguistic organization, and help clarify which phenomena require deeper explanation beyond random-text structure.",human
"This chapter presents perspectives for challenges and future development in building reliable AI systems, particularly, agentic AI systems. Several open research problems related to mitigating the risks of cascading failures are discussed. The chapter also sheds lights on research challenges and opportunities in aspects including dynamic environments, inconsistent task execution, unpredictable emergent behaviors, as well as resource-intensive reliability mechanisms. In addition, several research directions along the line of testing and evaluating reliability of agentic AI systems are also discussed.",human
"In the past two decades, open access to news and information has increased rapidly, empowering educated political growth within democratic societies. News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction.",human
"Sequence models for binary analysis are bottlenecked by byte-level tokenization: raw bytes waste precious context window capacity for transformers and other neural network architectures, and many existing text-oriented tokenizers fail on arbitrary 0x00--0xFF sequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.",human
"Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) remain fundamental to modern deep learning, yet their algorithmic details are rarely presented in complete, explicit \emph{batch matrix-form}. Rather, most references express gradients per sample or rely on automatic differentiation. Although automatic differentiation can achieve equally high computational efficiency, the usage of batch matrix-form makes the computational structure explicit, which is essential for transparent, systematic analysis, and optimization in settings such as sparse neural networks. This paper fills that gap by providing a mathematically rigorous and implementation-ready specification of MLPs in batch matrix-form. We derive forward and backward equations for all standard and advanced layers, including batch normalization and softmax, and validate all equations using the symbolic mathematics library SymPy. From these specifications, we construct uniform reference implementations in NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and a high-performance C++ backend optimized for sparse operations. Our main contributions are: (1) a complete derivation of batch matrix-form backpropagation for MLPs, (2) symbolic validation of all gradient equations, (3) uniform Python and C++ reference implementations grounded in a small set of matrix primitives, and (4) demonstration of how explicit formulations enable efficient sparse computation. Together, these results establish a validated, extensible foundation for understanding, teaching, and researching neural network algorithms.",human
"This study aims to systematically evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in abstract visual reasoning problems. We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions.",human
"As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.",human
"Graph machine learning has advanced rapidly in tasks such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and node classification. As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems.",human
"Medical imaging and multi-modal clinical settings often face the challange of missing modality in their diagnostic pipelines. Existing imputation methods either lack representational capacity or are computationally expensive. We propose PI-NAIM, a novel dual-path architecture that dynamically routes samples to optimized imputation approaches based on missingness complexity. Our framework integrates: (1) intelligent path routing that directs low missingness samples to efficient statistical imputation (MICE) and complex patterns to powerful neural networks (GAIN with temporal analysis); (2) cross-path attention fusion that leverages missingness-aware embeddings to intelligently combine both branches; and (3) end-to-end joint optimization of imputation accuracy and downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving RMSE of 0.108 (vs. baselines' 0.119-0.152) and substantial gains in downstream tasks with an AUROC of 0.812 for mortality prediction. PI-NAIM's modular design enables seamless integration into vision pipelines handling incomplete sensor measurements, missing modalities, or corrupted inputs, providing a unified solution for real-world scenario. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/AfifaKhaled/PI-NAIM-Path-Integrated-Neural-Adaptive-Imputation-Model",human
"Language models (LMs) underpin emerging mobile and embedded AI applications like meeting and video summarization and document analysis, which often require processing multiple long-context inputs. Running an LM locally on-device improves privacy, enables offline use, and reduces cost, but long-context inference quickly hits a \emph{memory capacity wall} as the key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with context length and batch size.   We present KVSwap, a software framework to break this memory wall by offloading the KV cache to non-volatile secondary storage (disk). KVSwap leverages the observation that only a small, dynamically changing subset of KV entries is critical for generation. It stores the full cache on disk, uses a compact in-memory metadata to predict which entries to preload, overlaps computation with hardware-aware disk access, and orchestrates read patterns to match storage device characteristics. Our evaluation shows that across representative LMs and storage types, KVSwap delivers higher throughput under tight memory budgets while maintaining the generation quality when compared with existing KV cache offloading schemes.",human
"We don't program neural networks directly. Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.",human
"Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) trained with Bidirectional Backpropagation (B-BP) often suffers from poor robustness and high sensitivity to noise and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel gradient-free training algorithm, the Bidirectional Subspace Rotation Algorithm (B-SRA), which significantly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of BAM. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify two key principles -- orthogonal weight matrices (OWM) and gradient-pattern alignment (GPA) -- as central to enhancing the robustness of BAM. Motivated by these findings, we introduce new regularization strategies into B-BP, resulting in models with greatly improved resistance to corruption and adversarial perturbations. We further conduct an ablation study across different training strategies to determine the most robust configuration and evaluate BAM's performance under a variety of attack scenarios and memory capacities, including 50, 100, and 200 associative pairs. Among all methods, the SAME configuration, which integrates both OWM and GPA, achieves the strongest resilience. Overall, our results demonstrate that B-SRA and the proposed regularization strategies lead to substantially more robust associative memories and open new directions for building resilient neural architectures.",human
"Fine-grained analysis of intraoperative behavior and its impact on patient outcomes remain a longstanding challenge. We present Frame-to-Outcome (F2O), an end-to-end system that translates tissue dissection videos into gesture sequences and uncovers patterns associated with postoperative outcomes. Leveraging transformer-based spatial and temporal modeling and frame-wise classification, F2O robustly detects consecutive short (~2 seconds) gestures in the nerve-sparing step of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (AUC: 0.80 frame-level; 0.81 video-level). F2O-derived features (gesture frequency, duration, and transitions) predicted postoperative outcomes with accuracy comparable to human annotations (0.79 vs. 0.75; overlapping 95% CI). Across 25 shared features, effect size directions were concordant with small differences (~ 0.07), and strong correlation (r = 0.96, p < 1e-14). F2O also captured key patterns linked to erectile function recovery, including prolonged tissue peeling and reduced energy use. By enabling automatic interpretable assessment, F2O establishes a foundation for data-driven surgical feedback and prospective clinical decision support.",human
"Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) show promise for diverse imaging tasks but often underperform on medical benchmarks. Prior efforts to improve performance include model finetuning, which requires large domain-specific datasets and significant compute, or manual prompt engineering, which is hard to generalize and often inaccessible to medical institutions seeking to deploy these tools. These challenges motivate interest in approaches that draw on a model's embedded knowledge while abstracting away dependence on human-designed prompts to enable scalable, weight-agnostic performance improvements. To explore this, we adapt the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) framework for structured automated prompt optimization in medical vision-language systems through a comprehensive, formal evaluation. We implement prompting pipelines for five medical imaging tasks across radiology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, evaluating 10 open-source VLMs with four prompt optimization techniques. Optimized pipelines achieved a median relative improvement of 53% over zero-shot prompting baselines, with the largest gains ranging from 300% to 3,400% on tasks where zero-shot performance is low. These results highlight the substantial potential of applying automated prompt optimization to medical AI systems, demonstrating significant gains for vision-based applications requiring accurate clinical image interpretation. By reducing dependence on prompt design to elicit intended outputs, these techniques allow clinicians to focus on patient care and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, our experiments offer scalability and preserve data privacy, demonstrating performance improvement on open-source VLMs. We publicly release our evaluation pipelines to support reproducible research on specialized medical tasks, available at https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab.",human
"The widespread reliance on open-source software dramatically increases the risk of vulnerability exploitation, underscoring the need for effective and scalable vulnerability detection (VD). Existing VD techniques, whether traditional machine learning-based or LLM-based approaches like prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, or off-policy preference optimization, remain fundamentally limited in their ability to perform context-aware analysis: They depend on fixed inputs or static preference datasets, cannot adaptively explore repository-level dependencies, and are constrained by function-level benchmarks that overlook critical vulnerability context.   This paper introduces Vulnerability-Adaptive Policy Optimization (VULPO), an on-policy LLM reinforcement learning framework for context-aware VD. To support training and evaluation, we first construct ContextVul, a new dataset that augments high-quality function-level samples with lightweight method to extract repository-level context information. We then design multi-dimensional reward structuring that jointly captures prediction correctness, vulnerability localization accuracy, and the semantic relevance of vulnerability analysis, thereby guiding the model toward comprehensive contextual reasoning. To address the asymmetric difficulty of different vulnerability cases and mitigate reward hacking, VULPO incorporates label-level and sample-level difficulty-adaptive reward scaling, encouraging the model to explore challenging cases while maintaining balanced reward distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VULPO framework in context-aware VD: Our VULPO-4B substantially outperforms existing VD baselines based on prompt engineering and off-policy optimization, improving F1 by 85% over Qwen3-4B and achieving performance comparable to a 150x larger-scale model, DeepSeek-R1-0528.",human
"Text-conditioned molecular generation aims to translate natural-language descriptions into chemical structures, enabling scientists to specify functional groups, scaffolds, and physicochemical constraints without handcrafted rules. Diffusion-based models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have recently shown promise by performing stochastic search in a continuous latent space that compactly captures molecular semantics. Yet existing methods rely on one-shot conditioning, where the entire prompt is encoded once and applied throughout diffusion, making it hard to satisfy all the requirements in the prompt. We discuss three outstanding challenges of one-shot conditioning generation, including the poor interpretability of the generated components, the failure to generate all substructures, and the overambition in considering all requirements simultaneously. We then propose three principles to address those challenges, motivated by which we propose Chain-of-Generation (CoG), a training-free multi-stage latent diffusion framework. CoG decomposes each prompt into curriculum-ordered semantic segments and progressively incorporates them as intermediate goals, guiding the denoising trajectory toward molecules that satisfy increasingly rich linguistic constraints. To reinforce semantic guidance, we further introduce a post-alignment learning phase that strengthens the correspondence between textual and molecular latent spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that CoG yields higher semantic alignment, diversity, and controllability than one-shot baselines, producing molecules that more faithfully reflect complex, compositional prompts while offering transparent insight into the generation process.",human
"Machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains, yet their lack of interpretability limits safe deployment in high-stakes settings. Counterfactual explanations are widely used to provide actionable ""what-if"" recourse, but they typically remain instance-specific and do not quantify which features systematically drive outcome changes within coherent regions of the feature space or across an entire dataset. We introduce FLEX (Feature importance from Layered counterfactual EXplanations), a model- and domain-agnostic framework that converts sets of counterfactuals into feature change frequency scores at local, regional, and global levels. FLEX generalises local change-frequency measures by aggregating across instances and neighbourhoods, offering interpretable rankings that reflect how often each feature must change to flip predictions. The framework is compatible with different counterfactual generation methods, allowing users to emphasise characteristics such as sparsity, feasibility, or actionability, thereby tailoring the derived feature importances to practical constraints. We evaluate FLEX on two contrasting tabular tasks: traffic accident severity prediction and loan approval, and compare FLEX to SHAP- and LIME-derived feature importance values. Results show that (i) FLEX's global rankings correlate with SHAP while surfacing additional drivers, and (ii) regional analyses reveal context-specific factors that global summaries miss. FLEX thus bridges the gap between local recourse and global attribution, supporting transparent and intervention-oriented decision-making in risk-sensitive applications.",human
"Smart cities and pervasive IoT deployments have generated interest in IoT data analysis across transportation and urban planning. At the same time, Large Language Models offer a new interface for exploring IoT data - particularly through natural language. Users today face two key challenges when working with IoT data using LLMs: (1) data collection infrastructure is expensive, producing terabytes of low-level sensor readings that are too granular for direct use, and (2) data analysis is slow, requiring iterative effort and technical expertise. Directly feeding all IoT telemetry to LLMs is impractical due to finite context windows, prohibitive token costs at scale, and non-interactive latencies. What is missing is a system that first parses a user's query to identify the analytical task, then selects the relevant data slices, and finally chooses the right representation before invoking an LLM.   We present Flash-Fusion, an end-to-end edge-cloud system that reduces the IoT data collection and analysis burden on users. Two principles guide its design: (1) edge-based statistical summarization (achieving 73.5% data reduction) to address data volume, and (2) cloud-based query planning that clusters behavioral data and assembles context-rich prompts to address data interpretation. We deploy Flash-Fusion on a university bus fleet and evaluate it against a baseline that feeds raw data to a state-of-the-art LLM. Flash-Fusion achieves a 95% latency reduction and 98% decrease in token usage and cost while maintaining high-quality responses. It enables personas across disciplines - safety officers, urban planners, fleet managers, and data scientists - to efficiently iterate over IoT data without the burden of manual query authoring or preprocessing.",human
"Mental health illness represents a substantial global socioeconomic burden, with COVID-19 further exacerbating accessibility challenges and driving increased demand for telehealth mental health support. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions through 24/7 availability and non-judgmental interactions, pre-trained models often lack the contextual and emotional awareness necessary for appropriate therapeutic responses. This paper investigated the application of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance GPT-2's capacity for therapeutic dialogue generation. The methodology restructured input formats to enable simultaneous processing of contextual information and emotional states alongside user input, employing a multi-component reward function that aligned model outputs with professional therapist responses and annotated emotions. Results demonstrated improvements through reinforcement learning over baseline GPT-2 across multiple evaluation metrics: BLEU (0.0111), ROUGE-1 (0.1397), ROUGE-2 (0.0213), ROUGE-L (0.1317), and METEOR (0.0581). LLM evaluation confirmed high contextual relevance and professionalism, while reinforcement learning achieved 99.34% emotion accuracy compared to 66.96% for baseline GPT-2. These findings demonstrate reinforcement learning's effectiveness in developing therapeutic dialogue systems that can serve as valuable assistive tools for therapists while maintaining essential human clinical oversight.",human
"Clinical notes contain valuable, context-rich information, but their unstructured format introduces several challenges, including unintended biases (e.g., gender or racial bias), and poor generalization across clinical settings (e.g., models trained on one EHR system may perform poorly on another due to format differences) and poor interpretability. To address these issues, we present ClinStructor, a pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to convert clinical free-text into structured, task-specific question-answer pairs prior to predictive modeling. Our method substantially enhances transparency and controllability and only leads to a modest reduction in predictive performance (a 2-3% drop in AUC), compared to direct fine-tuning, on the ICU mortality prediction task. ClinStructor lays a strong foundation for building reliable, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning models in clinical environments.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet still rely heavily on external supervision (e.g., curated labels). Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training. Experimental results show that PasoDoble can improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our project page is available at https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble.",human
"Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest CO$_2$ uptake (Gross Primary Production, GPP), remains a central challenge in terrestrial ecosystem research. While Eddy Covariance (EC) towers provide high-frequency estimates, their limited spatial coverage constrains large-scale assessments. Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative, yet most approaches rely on single-sensor spectral indices and statistical models that are often unable to capture the complex temporal dynamics of GPP. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and data fusion offer new opportunities to better represent the temporal dynamics of vegetation processes, but comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art DL models for multimodal GPP prediction remain scarce. Here, we explore the performance of two representative models for predicting GPP: 1) GPT-2, a transformer architecture, and 2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network, using multivariate inputs. Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures. Feature importance analysis reveals radiation as the dominant predictor, followed by Sentinel-2, MODIS land surface temperature, and Sentinel-1 contributions. Our results demonstrate how model architecture, context length, and multimodal inputs jointly determine performance in GPP prediction, guiding future developments of DL frameworks for monitoring terrestrial carbon dynamics.",human
"While large language models (LLMs) show transformative potential in healthcare, their development remains focused on high-resource languages, creating a critical barrier for others as simple translation fails to capture unique clinical and cultural nuances, such as endemic diseases. To address this, we introduce MedPT, the first large-scale, real-world corpus for Brazilian Portuguese, comprising 384,095 authentic question-answer pairs from patient-doctor interactions. The dataset underwent a meticulous multi-stage curation protocol, using a hybrid quantitative-qualitative analysis to filter noise and contextually enrich thousands of ambiguous queries. We further augmented the corpus via LLM-driven annotation, classifying questions into seven semantic types to capture user intent. Our analysis reveals its thematic breadth (3,200 topics) and unique linguistic properties, like the natural asymmetry in patient-doctor communication. To validate its utility, we benchmark a medical specialty routing task: fine-tuning a 1.7B parameter model achieves an outstanding 94\% F1-score on a 20-class setup. Furthermore, our qualitative error analysis shows misclassifications are not random but reflect genuine clinical ambiguities (e.g., between comorbid conditions), proving the dataset's deep semantic richness. We publicly release MedPT to foster the development of more equitable, accurate, and culturally-aware medical technologies for the Portuguese-speaking world.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have shown considerable promise in clinical natural language processing, yet few domain-specific datasets exist to rigorously evaluate their performance on radiology tasks. In this work, we introduce an annotated corpus of 6,393 radiology reports from 586 patients, each labeled for follow-up imaging status, to support the development and benchmarking of follow-up adherence detection systems. Using this corpus, we systematically compared traditional machine-learning classifiers, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Longformer, and a fully fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct, with recent generative LLMs. To evaluate generative LLMs, we tested GPT-4o and the open-source GPT-OSS-20B under two configurations: a baseline (Base) and a task-optimized (Advanced) setting that focused inputs on metadata, recommendation sentences, and their surrounding context. A refined prompt for GPT-OSS-20B further improved reasoning accuracy. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals estimated via non-parametric bootstrapping. Inter-annotator agreement was high (F1 = 0.846). GPT-4o (Advanced) achieved the best performance (F1 = 0.832), followed closely by GPT-OSS-20B (Advanced; F1 = 0.828). LR and SVM also performed strongly (F1 = 0.776 and 0.775), underscoring that while LLMs approach human-level agreement through prompt optimization, interpretable and resource-efficient models remain valuable baselines.",human
"The dynamic range of imaging detectors flown on-board X-ray observatories often only covers a limited flux range of extrasolar X-ray sources. The analysis of bright X-ray sources is complicated by so-called pile-up, which results from high incident photon flux. This nonlinear effect distorts the measured spectrum, resulting in biases in the inferred physical parameters, and can even lead to a complete signal loss in extreme cases. Piled-up data are commonly discarded due to resulting intractability of the likelihood. As a result, a large number of archival observations remain underexplored. We present a machine learning solution to this problem, using a simulation-based inference framework that allows us to estimate posterior distributions of physical source parameters from piled-up eROSITA data. We show that a normalizing flow produces better-constrained posterior densities than traditional mitigation techniques, as more data can be leveraged. We consider model- and calibration-dependent uncertainties and the applicability of such an algorithm to real data in the eROSITA archive.",human
"Story understanding and analysis have long been challenging areas within Natural Language Understanding. Automated narrative analysis requires deep computational semantic representations along with syntactic processing. Moreover, the large volume of narrative data demands automated semantic analysis and computational learning rather than manual analytical approaches. In this paper, we propose a framework that analyzes the sentiment arcs of movie scripts and performs extended analysis related to the context of the characters involved. The framework enables the extraction of high-level and low-level concepts conveyed through the narrative. Using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, our approach applies a custom lexicon built with the LabMTsimple storylab module. The custom lexicon is based on the Valence, Arousal, and Dominance scores from the NRC-VAD dataset. Furthermore, the framework advances the analysis by clustering similar sentiment plots using Wards hierarchical clustering technique. Experimental evaluation on a movie dataset shows that the resulting analysis is helpful to consumers and readers when selecting a narrative or story.",human
"Recent advances in time series research facilitate the development of foundation models. While many state-of-the-art time series foundation models have been introduced, few studies examine their effectiveness in specific downstream applications in physical science.

Using the CAMELS-US dataset, which includes rainfall and runoff data from 671 locations with six time series streams and 30 static features, we compare baseline and foundation models. Results demonstrate that models incorporating comprehensive known exogenous inputs outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, incorporating natural annual periodic time series contribute the most significant improvements.",human
"Ensuring worker safety remains a critical challenge in modern manufacturing environments. Industry 5.0 reorients the prevailing manufacturing paradigm toward more human-centric operations. Using a design science research methodology, we identify three essential requirements for next-generation safety training systems: high accuracy, low latency, and low cost. We introduce a multimodal chatbot powered by large language models that meets these design requirements. The chatbot uses retrieval-augmented generation to ground its responses in curated regulatory and technical documentation. To evaluate our solution, we developed a domain-specific benchmark of expert-validated question and answer pairs for three representative machines: a Bridgeport manual mill, a Haas TL-1 CNC lathe, and a Universal Robots UR5e collaborative robot. We tested 24 RAG configurations using a full-factorial design and assessed them with automated evaluations of correctness, latency, and cost. Our top 2 configurations were then evaluated by ten industry experts and academic researchers. Our results show that retrieval strategy and model configuration have a significant impact on performance. The top configuration (selected for chatbot deployment) achieved an accuracy of 86.66%, an average latency of 10.04 seconds, and an average cost of $0.005 per query. Overall, our work provides three contributions: an open-source, domain-grounded safety training chatbot; a validated benchmark for evaluating AI-assisted safety instruction; and a systematic methodology for designing and assessing AI-enabled instructional and immersive safety training systems for Industry 5.0 environments.",human
"Deep-sea exploration poses significant challenges, including disorientation, communication loss, and navigational failures in dynamic underwater environments. This paper presents an Autonomous Underwater Cognitive System (AUCS) that integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a Soar-based cognitive architecture to enable adaptive navigation in complex oceanic conditions. The system fuses multi-sensor data from SONAR, LiDAR, IMU, and DVL with cognitive reasoning modules for perception, attention, planning, and learning. Unlike conventional SLAM systems, AUCS incorporates semantic understanding, adaptive sensor management, and memory-based learning to differentiate between dynamic and static objects, reducing false loop closures and enhancing long-term map consistency. The proposed architecture demonstrates a complete perception-cognition-action-learning loop, allowing autonomous underwater vehicles to sense, reason, and adapt intelligently. This work lays a foundation for next-generation cognitive submersible systems, improving safety, reliability, and autonomy in deep-sea exploration.",human
"Transparency and security are both central to Responsible AI, but they may conflict in adversarial settings. We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security.",human
"When large language models (LLMs) are aligned to a specific online community, do they exhibit generalizable behavioral patterns that mirror that community's attitudes and responses to new uncertainty, or are they simply recalling patterns from training data? We introduce a framework to test epistemic stance transfer: targeted deletion of event knowledge, validated with multiple probes, followed by evaluation of whether models still reproduce the community's organic response patterns under ignorance. Using Russian--Ukrainian military discourse and U.S. partisan Twitter data, we find that even after aggressive fact removal, aligned LLMs maintain stable, community-specific behavioral patterns for handling uncertainty. These results provide evidence that alignment encodes structured, generalizable behaviors beyond surface mimicry. Our framework offers a systematic way to detect behavioral biases that persist under ignorance, advancing efforts toward safer and more transparent LLM deployments.",human
"Machining process planning (MP) is inherently complex due to structural and geometrical dependencies among part features and machining operations. A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs. We evaluate MP-GFormer on a synthesized dataset and demonstrate that the method achieves improvements of 24\% and 36\% in accuracy for main and sub-operation predictions, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",human
"The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in healthcare is impeded by significant security challenges unaddressed by traditional frameworks, precisely the data-in-use gap where sensitive patient data and proprietary AI models are exposed during active processing. To address this, the paper proposes the Confidential Zero-Trust Framework (CZF), a novel security paradigm that synergistically combines Zero-Trust Architecture for granular access control with the hardware-enforced data isolation of Confidential Computing. We detailed a multi-tiered architectural blueprint for implementing the CZF on Google Cloud and analyzed its efficacy against real-world threats. The CZF provides a defense-in-depth architecture where data remains encrypted while in-use within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The framework's use of remote attestation offers cryptographic proof of workload integrity, transforming compliance from a procedural exercise into a verifiable technical fact and enabling secure, multi-party collaborations previously blocked by security and intellectual property concerns. By closing the data-in-use gap and enforcing Zero-Trust principles, the CZF provides a robust and verifiable framework that establishes the necessary foundation of trust to enable the responsible adoption of transformative AI technologies in healthcare.",human
"Adversarial robustness remains a critical challenge in deploying neural network classifiers, particularly in real-time systems where ground-truth labels are unavailable during inference. This paper investigates \textit{Volatility in Certainty} (VC), a recently proposed, label-free metric that quantifies irregularities in model confidence by measuring the dispersion of sorted softmax outputs. Specifically, VC is defined as the average squared log-ratio of adjacent certainty values, capturing local fluctuations in model output smoothness. We evaluate VC as a proxy for classification accuracy and as an indicator of adversarial drift. Experiments are conducted on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on MNIST, as well as a regularized VGG-like model trained on CIFAR-10. Adversarial examples are generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) across varying perturbation magnitudes. In addition, mixed test sets are created by gradually introducing adversarial contamination to assess VC's sensitivity under incremental distribution shifts. Our results reveal a strong negative correlation between classification accuracy and log(VC) (correlation rho < -0.90 in most cases), suggesting that VC effectively reflects performance degradation without requiring labeled data. These findings position VC as a scalable, architecture-agnostic, and real-time performance metric suitable for early-warning systems in safety-critical applications.",human
"Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically align visual features from an encoder with a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception. The data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wenhao-Zhou/TopoPerception.",human
"We consider a discrete-time formulation for a class of high-dimensional stochastic joint replenishment problems. First, we approximate the problem by a continuous-time impulse control problem. Exploiting connections among the impulse control problem, backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jumps, and the stochastic target problem, we develop a novel, simulation-based computational method that relies on deep neural networks to solve the impulse control problem. Based on that solution, we propose an implementable inventory control policy for the original (discrete-time) stochastic joint replenishment problem, and test it against the best available benchmarks in a series of test problems. For the problems studied thus far, our method matches or beats the best benchmark we could find, and it is computationally feasible up to at least 50 dimensions -- that is, 50 stock-keeping units (SKUs).",human
"Autoformalization, the process of translating informal statements into formal logic, has gained renewed interest with the emergence of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application.",human
"While large language models (LLMs) have recently made tremendous progress towards solving challenging AI problems, they have done so at increasingly steep computational and API costs. We propose a novel strategy where we combine multiple LLM models with varying cost/accuracy tradeoffs in an agentic manner, where models and tools are run in sequence as determined by an orchestration model to minimize cost subject to a user-specified level of reliability; this constraint is formalized using conformal prediction to provide guarantees. To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability. Our approach provides a principled and practical framework for deploying LLM agents that are significantly more cost-effective while maintaining reliability.",human
"Speech quality and intelligibility are significantly degraded in noisy environments. This paper presents a novel transformer-based learning framework to address the single-channel noise suppression problem for real-time applications. Although existing deep learning networks have shown remarkable improvements in handling stationary noise, their performance often diminishes in real-world environments characterized by non-stationary noise (e.g., dog barking, baby crying). The proposed dual-input acoustic-image feature fusion using a hybrid ViT framework effectively models both temporal and spectral dependencies in noisy signals. Designed for real-world audio environments, the proposed framework is computationally lightweight and suitable for implementation on embedded devices. To evaluate its effectiveness, four standard and commonly used quality measurements, namely PESQ, STOI, Seg SNR, and LLR, are utilized. Experimental results obtained using the Librispeech dataset as the clean speech source and the UrbanSound8K and Google Audioset datasets as the noise sources, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves noise reduction, speech intelligibility, and perceptual quality compared to the noisy input signal, achieving performance close to the clean reference.",human
"Information extraction from regulatory documents using large language models presents critical trade-offs between performance and computational resources. We evaluated seven open-weight models (0.6B-70B parameters) on hydropower licensing documentation to provide empirical deployment guidance.   Our analysis identified a pronounced 14B parameter threshold where validation methods transition from ineffective (F1 $<$ 0.15) to viable (F1 = 0.64). Consumer-deployable models achieve 64\% F1 through appropriate validation, while smaller models plateau at 51\%. Large-scale models approach 77\% F1 but require enterprise infrastructure.   We identified systematic hallucination patterns where perfect recall indicates extraction failure rather than success in smaller models. Our findings establish the first comprehensive resource-performance mapping for open-weight information extraction in regulatory contexts, enabling evidence-based model selection.   These results provide immediate value for hydropower compliance while contributing insights into parameter scaling effects that generalize across information extraction tasks.",human
"Dimension theory is a branch of topology concerned with defining and analyzing dimensions of geometric and topological spaces in purely topological terms. In this work, we adapt the classical notion of topological dimension (Lebesgue covering) to binary concept classes. The topological space naturally associated with a concept class is its space of realizable distributions. The loss function and the class itself induce a simplicial structure on this space, with respect to which we define a simplicial covering dimension.   We prove that for finite concept classes, this simplicial covering dimension exactly characterizes the list replicability number (equivalently, global stability) in PAC learning. This connection allows us to apply tools from classical dimension theory to compute the exact list replicability number of the broad family of extremal concept classes.",human
"Time series forecasting is essential in a wide range of real world applications. Recently, frequency-domain methods have attracted increasing interest for their ability to capture global dependencies. However, when applied to non-stationary time series, these methods encounter the $\textit{spectral entanglement}$ and the computational burden of complex-valued learning. The $\textit{spectral entanglement}$ refers to the overlap of trends, periodicities, and noise across the spectrum due to $\textit{spectral leakage}$ and the presence of non-stationarity. However, existing decompositions are not suited to resolving spectral entanglement. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Network (FreDN), which introduces a learnable Frequency Disentangler module to separate trend and periodic components directly in the frequency domain. Furthermore, we propose a theoretically supported ReIm Block to reduce the complexity of complex-valued operations while maintaining performance. We also re-examine the frequency-domain loss function and provide new theoretical insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on seven long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that FreDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10\%. Furthermore, compared with standard complex-valued architectures, our real-imaginary shared-parameter design reduces the parameter count and computational cost by at least 50\%.",human
"Due to its expressiveness and unambiguous nature, First-Order Logic (FOL) is a powerful formalism for representing concepts expressed in natural language (NL). This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse.",human
"Language models (LMs) are said to be exhibiting reasoning, but what does this entail? We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are ""statistical pattern matchers"""" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency. This distinction is fundamental to how epistemic uncertainty is evaluated in LMs. We invite a discussion on the importance of how the computational processes of the systems we build and analyze in NLP research are described.",human
"Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical. Code is available at: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/flash-moba.",human
"We present \textsf{ModularSubsetSelection} (MSS), a new algorithm for locally differentially private (LDP) frequency estimation. Given a universe of size $k$ and $n$ users, our $\varepsilon$-LDP mechanism encodes each input via a Residue Number System (RNS) over $\ell$ pairwise-coprime moduli $m_0, \ldots, m_{\ell-1}$, and reports a randomly chosen index $j \in [\ell]$ along with the perturbed residue using the statistically optimal \textsf{SubsetSelection} (SS) (Wang et al. 2016). This design reduces the user communication cost from $Θ\bigl(ω\log_2(k/ω)\bigr)$ bits required by standard SS (with $ω\approx k/(e^\varepsilon+1)$) down to $\lceil \log_2 \ell \rceil + \lceil \log_2 m_j \rceil$ bits, where $m_j < k$. Server-side decoding runs in $Θ(n + r k \ell)$ time, where $r$ is the number of LSMR (Fong and Saunders 2011) iterations. In practice, with well-conditioned moduli (\textit{i.e.}, constant $r$ and $\ell = Θ(\log k)$), this becomes $Θ(n + k \log k)$. We prove that MSS achieves worst-case MSE within a constant factor of state-of-the-art protocols such as SS and \textsf{ProjectiveGeometryResponse} (PGR) (Feldman et al. 2022) while avoiding the algebraic prerequisites and dynamic-programming decoder required by PGR. Empirically, MSS matches the estimation accuracy of SS, PGR, and \textsf{RAPPOR} (Erlingsson, Pihur, and Korolova 2014) across realistic $(k, \varepsilon)$ settings, while offering faster decoding than PGR and shorter user messages than SS. Lastly, by sampling from multiple moduli and reporting only a single perturbed residue, MSS achieves the lowest reconstruction-attack success rate among all evaluated LDP protocols.",human
"We study randomized experiments in bipartite systems where only a subset of treatment-side units are eligible for assignment while all units continue to interact, generating interference. We formalize eligibility-constrained bipartite experiments and define estimands aligned with full deployment: the Primary Total Treatment Effect (PTTE) on eligible units and the Secondary Total Treatment Effect (STTE) on ineligible units. Under randomization within the eligible set, we give identification conditions and develop interference-aware ensemble estimators that combine exposure mappings, generalized propensity scores, and flexible machine learning. We further introduce a projection that links treatment- and outcome-level estimands; this mapping is exact under a Linear Additive Edges condition and enables estimation on the (typically much smaller) treatment side with deterministic aggregation to outcomes. In simulations with known ground truth across realistic exposure regimes, the proposed estimators recover PTTE and STTE with low bias and variance and reduce the bias that could arise when interference is ignored. Two field experiments illustrate practical relevance: our method corrects the direction of expected interference bias for a pre-specified metric in both studies and reverses the sign and significance of the primary decision metric in one case.",human
"Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.",human
"In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.",human
"We present MiroThinker v1.0, an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities. Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.",human
"Autonomous laboratories typically rely on data-driven decision-making, occasionally with human-in-the-loop oversight to inject domain expertise. Fully leveraging AI agents, however, requires tightly coupled, collaborative workflows spanning hypothesis generation, experimental planning, execution, and interpretation. To address this, we develop and deploy a human-AI collaborative (HAIC) workflow that integrates large language models for hypothesis generation and analysis, with collaborative policy updates driving autonomous pulsed laser deposition (PLD) experiments for remote epitaxy of BaTiO$_3$/graphene. HAIC accelerated the hypothesis formation and experimental design and efficiently mapped the growth space to graphene-damage. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that chemistry drives degradation while the highest energy plume components seed defects, identifying a low-O$_2$ pressure low-temperature synthesis window that preserves graphene but is incompatible with optimal BaTiO$_3$ growth. Thus, we show a two-step Ar/O$_2$ deposition is required to exfoliate ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ while maintaining a monolayer graphene interlayer. HAIC stages human insight with AI reasoning between autonomous batches to drive rapid scientific progress, providing an evolution to many existing human-in-the-loop autonomous workflows.",human
"In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.",human
"The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining alignment. For pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.",human
"Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.",human
"Multi-swarm particle optimisation algorithms are gaining popularity due to their ability to locate multiple optimum points concurrently. In this family of algorithms, clustering-based multi-swarm algorithms are among the most effective techniques that join the closest particles together to form independent niche swarms that exploit potential promising regions. However, most clustering-based multi-swarms are Euclidean distance-based and only inquire about the potential of one peak within a cluster and thus can lose multiple peaks due to poor resolution. In a bid to improve the peak detection ratio, the current study proposes two enhancements. First, a preliminary local search across initial particles is proposed to ensure that each local region is sufficiently scouted prior to particle collaboration. Secondly, an investigative clustering approach that performs concavity analysis is proposed to evaluate the potential for several sub-niches within a single cluster. An improved clustering-based multi-swarm PSO (TImPSO) has resulted from these enhancements and has been tested against three competing algorithms in the same family using the IEEE CEC2013 niching datasets, resulting in an improved peak ratio for almost all the test functions.",human
"Large language models are increasingly being used in critical domains of politics, business, and education, but the nature of their normative ethical judgment remains opaque. Alignment research has, to date, not sufficiently utilized perspectives and insights from the field of moral psychology to inform training and evaluation of frontier models. I perform a synthetic experiment on a wide range of models from most major model providers using Jonathan Haidt's influential moral foundations theory (MFT) to elicit diverse value judgments from LLMs. Using multiple descriptive statistical approaches, I document the bias and variance of large language model responses relative to a human baseline in the original survey. My results suggest that models rely on different moral foundations from one another and from a nationally representative human baseline, and these differences increase as model capabilities increase. This work seeks to spur further analysis of LLMs using MFT, including finetuning of open-source models, and greater deliberation by policymakers on the importance of moral foundations for LLM alignment.",human
"Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are increasingly used to simulate human interactions and solve collaborative tasks. A common practice is to assign agents with personas to encourage behavioral diversity. However, this raises a critical yet underexplored question: do personas introduce biases into multi-agent interactions? This paper presents a systematic investigation into persona-induced biases in multi-agent interactions, with a focus on social traits like trustworthiness (how an agent's opinion is received by others) and insistence (how strongly an agent advocates for its opinion). Through a series of controlled experiments in collaborative problem-solving and persuasion tasks, we reveal that (1) LLM-based agents exhibit biases in both trustworthiness and insistence, with personas from historically advantaged groups (e.g., men and White individuals) perceived as less trustworthy and demonstrating less insistence; and (2) agents exhibit significant in-group favoritism, showing a higher tendency to conform to others who share the same persona. These biases persist across various LLMs, group sizes, and numbers of interaction rounds, highlighting an urgent need for awareness and mitigation to ensure the fairness and reliability of multi-agent systems.",human
"Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.   In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].   Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].",human
"Ergodic control synthesizes optimal coverage behaviors over spatial distributions for nonlinear systems. However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.",human
"The optimal assignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized roles in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge, defined by a vast combinatorial search space, expensive black-box evaluations, and an inherent trade-off between performance and cost. Current optimization methods focus on single-agent settings and lack a principled framework for this multi-agent, multi-objective problem.   This thesis introduces MALBO (Multi-Agent LLM Bayesian Optimization), a systematic framework designed to automate the efficient composition of LLM-based agent teams. We formalize the assignment challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to identify the Pareto front of configurations between task accuracy and inference cost. The methodology employs multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) with independent Gaussian Process surrogate models. By searching over a continuous feature-space representation of the LLMs, this approach performs a sample-efficient exploration guided by the expected hypervolume improvement.   The primary contribution is a principled and automated methodology that yields a Pareto front of optimal team configurations. Our results demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization phase, compared to an initial random search, maintained a comparable average performance while reducing the average configuration cost by over 45%. Furthermore, MALBO identified specialized, heterogeneous teams that achieve cost reductions of up to 65.8% compared to homogeneous baselines, all while maintaining maximum performance. The framework thus provides a data-driven tool for deploying cost-effective and highly specialized multi-agent AI systems.",human
"Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move",human
"Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet their outputs often suffer from misalignment with human preferences due to the inadequacy of weak supervision and a lack of fine-grained control. Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.",human
"Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.",human
"Systematics contaminate observables, leading to distribution shifts relative to theoretically simulated signals-posing a major challenge for using pre-trained models to label such observables. Since systematics are often poorly understood and difficult to model, removing them directly and entirely may not be feasible. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that aligns learned features between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by optimizing a feature-alignment loss on the representations extracted from a pre-trained ID model. We first experimentally validate the method on the MNIST dataset using possible alignment losses, including mean squared error and optimal transport, and subsequently apply it to large-scale maps of neutral hydrogen. Our results show that optimal transport is particularly effective at aligning OOD features when parity between ID and OOD samples is unknown, even with limited data-mimicking real-world conditions in extracting information from large-scale surveys. Our code is available at https://github.com/sultan-hassan/feature-alignment-for-OOD-generalization.",human
"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.",human
"Modern language models fail a fundamental requirement of trustworthy intelligence: knowing when not to answer. Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$λ$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $λ$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.",human
"We consider the problems of \emph{learning} and \emph{testing} real-valued convex functions over Gaussian space. Despite the extensive study of function convexity across mathematics, statistics, and computer science, its learnability and testability have largely been examined only in discrete or restricted settings -- typically with respect to the Hamming distance, which is ill-suited for real-valued functions.   In contrast, we study these problems in high dimensions under the standard Gaussian measure, assuming sample access to the function and a mild smoothness condition, namely Lipschitzness. A smoothness assumption is natural and, in fact, necessary even in one dimension: without it, convexity cannot be inferred from finitely many samples. As our main results, we give:   - Learning Convex Functions: An agnostic proper learning algorithm for Lipschitz convex functions that achieves error $\varepsilon$ using $n^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ samples, together with a complementary lower bound of $n^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$ samples in the \emph{correlational statistical query (CSQ)} model.   - Testing Convex Functions: A tolerant (two-sided) tester for convexity of Lipschitz functions with the same sample complexity (as a corollary of our learning result), and a one-sided tester (which never rejects convex functions) using $O(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)^n$ samples.",human
"In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.",human
"Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.",human
"Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.",human
"Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.",human
"Effective decision-making often relies on timely insights from complex visual data. While Information Visualization (InfoVis) dashboards can support this process, they rarely adapt to users' cognitive state, and less so in real time. We present Symbiotik, an intelligent, context-aware adaptive visualization system that leverages neurophysiological signals to estimate mental workload (MWL) and dynamically adapt visual dashboards using reinforcement learning (RL). Through a user study with 120 participants and three visualization types, we demonstrate that our approach improves task performance and engagement. Symbiotik offers a scalable, real-time adaptation architecture, and a validated methodology for neuroadaptive user interfaces.",human
"We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

"Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.",human
"The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.",human
"Recently, several instances of non-Euclidean SGD, including SignSGD, Lion, and Muon, have attracted significant interest from the optimization community due to their practical success in training deep neural networks. Consequently, a number of works have attempted to explain this success by developing theoretical convergence analyses. Unfortunately, these results cannot properly justify the superior performance of these methods, as they could not beat the convergence rate of vanilla Euclidean SGD. We resolve this important open problem by developing a new unified convergence analysis under the structured smoothness and gradient noise assumption. In particular, our results indicate that non-Euclidean SGD (i) can exploit the sparsity or low-rank structure of the upper bounds on the Hessian and gradient noise, (ii) can provably benefit from popular algorithmic tools such as extrapolation or momentum variance reduction, and (iii) can match the state-of-the-art convergence rates of adaptive and more complex optimization algorithms such as AdaGrad and Shampoo.",human
"The routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) has become the de facto routing standard for resource-constrained IoT systems, but its lightweight design exposes critical vulnerabilities to a wide range of routing-layer attacks such as hello flood, decreased rank, and version number manipulation. Traditional countermeasures, including protocol-level modifications and machine learning classifiers, can achieve high accuracy against known threats, yet they fail when confronted with novel or zero-day attacks unless fully retrained, an approach that is impractical for dynamic IoT environments. In this paper, we investigate incremental learning as a practical and adaptive strategy for intrusion detection in RPL-based networks. We systematically evaluate five model families, including ensemble models and deep learning models. Our analysis highlights that incremental learning not only restores detection performance on new attack classes but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously learned threats, all while reducing training time compared to full retraining. By combining five diverse models with attack-specific analysis, forgetting behavior, and time efficiency, this study provides systematic evidence that incremental learning offers a scalable pathway to maintain resilient intrusion detection in evolving RPL-based IoT networks.",human
"We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.   The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.",human
"Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.",human
"There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.",human
"Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has emerged as a transformative approach in computational pathology. By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.",human
"We introduce VoxTell, a vision-language model for text-prompted volumetric medical image segmentation. It maps free-form descriptions, from single words to full clinical sentences, to 3D masks.

It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across modalities on unseen datasets, excelling on familiar concepts while generalizing to related unseen classes.

"Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations.

DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.",human
"Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.",human
"Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.   We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.",human
"Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.",human
"Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

"Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.",human
"Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.",human
"Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace"" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.",human
"Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.",human
"We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.",human
"Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.   In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.",human
"This data paper introduces MajinBook, an open catalogue designed to facilitate the use of shadow libraries--such as Library Genesis and Z-Library--for computational social science and cultural analytics. By linking metadata from these vast, crowd-sourced archives with structured bibliographic data from Goodreads, we create a high-precision corpus of over 539,000 references to English-language books spanning three centuries, enriched with first publication dates, genres, and popularity metrics like ratings and reviews. Our methodology prioritizes natively digital EPUB files to ensure machine-readable quality, while addressing biases in traditional corpora like HathiTrust, and includes secondary datasets for French, German, and Spanish. We evaluate the linkage strategy for accuracy, release all underlying data openly, and discuss the project's legal permissibility under EU and US frameworks for text and data mining in research.",human
"Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.",human
"Quantum Computing is a rapidly developing field with the potential to tackle the increasing computational challenges faced in high-energy physics. In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of variational quantum algorithms in solving the particle track reconstruction problem. We present an analysis of two distinct formulations for identifying straight-line tracks in a multilayer detection system, inspired by the LHCb vertex detector. The first approach is formulated as a ground-state energy problem, while the second approach is formulated as a system of linear equations. This work addresses one of the main challenges when dealing with variational quantum algorithms on general problems, namely designing an expressive and efficient quantum ansatz working on tracking events with fixed detector geometry. For this purpose, we employed a quantum architecture search method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to design the quantum circuits for different problem sizes. We provide experimental results to test our approach on both formulations for different problem sizes in terms of performance and computational cost.",human
"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.",human
"Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.",human
"According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.",human
"We propose a spectrally normalized surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees. Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the Löwner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.",human
"Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been repeatedly proposed as a biometric modality, often with reports of high accuracy and operational feasibility. However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security lens, analyzing how existing works diverge in sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility.   To this end, we construct a unified evaluation framework to expose these issues empirically and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics such as per-class EER, Frequency Count of Scores (FCS), and the Gini Coefficient uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. The resulting analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces--including replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation--and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.",human
"Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling with spatial context, offering unprecedented insights into the tissue microenvironment. However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to ""speak"" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance. Crucially, the FSM module exhibits plug-and-play versatility, consistently improving the performance when integrated into other baseline methods.",human
"Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.",human
"Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.",human
"On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.",human
"Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.",human
"Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.",human
"We introduce KarmaTS, an interactive framework for constructing lag-indexed, executable spatiotemporal causal graphical models for multivariate time series (MTS) simulation. Motivated by the challenge of access-restricted physiological data, KarmaTS generates synthetic MTS with known causal dynamics and augments real-world datasets with expert knowledge. The system constructs a discrete-time structural causal process (DSCP) by combining expert knowledge and algorithmic proposals in a mixed-initiative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The resulting DSCP supports simulation and causal interventions, including those under user-specified distribution shifts. KarmaTS handles mixed variable types, contemporaneous and lagged edges, and modular edge functionals ranging from parameterizable templates to neural network models. Together, these features enable flexible validation and benchmarking of causal discovery algorithms through expert-informed simulation.",human
"Jailbreak attacks designed to bypass safety mechanisms pose a serious threat by prompting LLMs to generate harmful or inappropriate content, despite alignment with ethical guidelines. Crafting universal filtering rules remains difficult due to their inherent dependence on specific contexts. To address these challenges without relying on threshold calibration or model fine-tuning, this work introduces a semantic consistency analysis between successful and unsuccessful responses, demonstrating that a negation-aware scoring approach captures meaningful patterns. Building on this insight, a novel detection framework called NegBLEURT Forest is proposed to evaluate the degree of alignment between outputs elicited by adversarial prompts and expected safe behaviors. It identifies anomalous responses using the Isolation Forest algorithm, enabling reliable jailbreak detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method consistently achieves top-tier performance, ranking first or second in accuracy across diverse models using the crafted dataset, while competing approaches exhibit notable sensitivity to model and data variations.",human
"Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.",human
"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has rapidly emerged as a transformative approach for integrating large language models into clinical and biomedical workflows. However, privacy risks, such as protected health information (PHI) exposure, remain inconsistently mitigated. This review provides a thorough analysis of the current landscape of RAG applications in healthcare, including (i) sensitive data type across clinical scenarios, (ii) the associated privacy risks, (iii) current and emerging data-privacy protection mechanisms and (iv) future direction for patient data privacy protection. We synthesize 23 articles on RAG applications in healthcare and systematically analyze privacy challenges through a pipeline-structured framework encompassing data storage, transmission, retrieval and generation stages, delineating potential failure modes, their underlying causes in threat models and system mechanisms, and their practical implications. Building on this analysis, we critically review 17 articles on privacy-preserving strategies for RAG systems. Our evaluation reveals critical gaps, including insufficient clinical validation, absence of standardized evaluation frameworks, and lack of automated assessment tools. We propose actionable directions based on these limitations and conclude with a call to action. This review provides researchers and practitioners with a structured framework for understanding privacy vulnerabilities in healthcare RAG and offers a roadmap toward developing systems that achieve both clinical effectiveness and robust privacy preservation.",human
"Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a prominent strategy to significantly speed up generation in large language models (LLMs), including byte-level LLMs, which are tokeniser-free but prohibitively slow. However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM. We also rigorously study the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and latency when exploring the possible parameterisations of MTPC, such as PC architectures and partial layer sharing between the verifier and draft LLMs.",human
"The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.   This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.",human
"The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.",human
"The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.",human
"ReLU activations are the main bottleneck in Private Inference that is based on ResNet networks. This is because they incur significant inference latency. Reducing ReLU count is a discrete optimization problem, and there are two common ways to approach it. Most current state-of-the-art methods are based on a smooth approximation that jointly optimizes network accuracy and ReLU budget at once. However, the last hard thresholding step of the optimization usually introduces a large performance loss. We take an alternative approach that works directly in the discrete domain by leveraging Coordinate Descent as our optimization framework. In contrast to previous methods, this yields a sparse solution by design. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments, that our method is State of the Art on common benchmarks.",human
"Digitized histopathology analysis involves complex, time-intensive workflows and specialized expertise, limiting its accessibility.

NOVA integrates 49 domain-specific tools (e.g., nuclei segmentation, whole-slide encoding) built on open-source software, and can also create new tools ad hoc. To evaluate such systems, we present SlideQuest, a 90-question benchmark -- verified by pathologists and biomedical scientists -- spanning data processing, quantitative analysis, and hypothesis testing. Unlike prior biomedical benchmarks focused on knowledge recall or diagnostic QA, SlideQuest demands multi-step reasoning, iterative coding, and computational problem solving. Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, and a pathologist-verified case study links morphology to prognostically relevant PAM50 subtypes, demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.",human
"Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.",human
"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, sparse, biologically inspired computation. Training them with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and surrogate gradients achieves strong performance but remains biologically implausible. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) provides a more local and biologically grounded alternative. However, existing EP frameworks, primarily based on deterministic neurons, either require complex mechanisms to handle discontinuities in spiking dynamics or fail to scale beyond simple visual tasks. Inspired by the stochastic nature of biological spiking mechanism and recent hardware trends, we propose a stochastic EP framework that integrates probabilistic spiking neurons into the EP paradigm. This formulation smoothens the optimization landscape, stabilizes training, and enables scalable learning in deep convolutional spiking convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the proposed stochastic EP dynamics approximate deterministic EP under mean-field theory, thereby inheriting its underlying theoretical guarantees. The proposed framework narrows the gap to both BPTT-trained SNNs and EP-trained non-spiking CRNNs in vision benchmarks while preserving locality, highlighting stochastic EP as a promising direction for neuromorphic and on-chip learning.",human
"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.",human
"The field of computer vision is undergoing a paradigm shift toward large-scale foundation model pre-training via self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.",human
"Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).",human
"We introduce MOON, our comprehensive set of sustainable iterative practices for multimodal representation learning for e-commerce applications. MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of ""Pretraining, Post-training, and Application"", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.",human
"Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.",human
"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.",human
"Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.",human
"Early detection of faults in district heating substations is imperative to reduce return temperatures and enhance efficiency. However, progress in this domain has been hindered by the limited availability of public, labelled datasets. We present an open source framework combining a service report validated public dataset, an evaluation method based on Accuracy, Reliability, and Earliness, and baseline results implemented with EnergyFaultDetector, an open source Python framework.   The dataset contains time series of operational data from 93 substations across two manufacturers, annotated with a list of disturbances due to faults and maintenance actions, a set of normal-event examples and detailed fault metadata. We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.   Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.",human
"Linear models are widely used in high-stakes decision-making due to their simplicity and interpretability. Yet when fairness constraints such as demographic parity are introduced, their effects on model coefficients, and thus on how predictive bias is distributed across features, remain opaque. Existing approaches on linear models often rely on strong and unrealistic assumptions, or overlook the explicit role of the sensitive attribute, limiting their practical utility for fairness assessment. We extend the work of (Chzhen and Schreuder, 2022) and (Fukuchi and Sakuma, 2023) by proposing a post-processing framework that can be applied on top of any linear model to decompose the resulting bias into direct (sensitive-attribute) and indirect (correlated-features) components. Our method analytically characterizes how demographic parity reshapes each model coefficient, including those of both sensitive and non-sensitive features. This enables a transparent, feature-level interpretation of fairness interventions and reveals how bias may persist or shift through correlated variables. Our framework requires no retraining and provides actionable insights for model auditing and mitigation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method captures fairness dynamics missed by prior work, offering a practical and interpretable tool for responsible deployment of linear models.",human
"Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.",human
"The increasing deployment of autonomous AI agents on the web is hampered by a fundamental misalignment: agents must infer affordances from human-oriented user interfaces, leading to brittle, inefficient, and insecure interactions. To address this, we introduce VOIX, a web-native framework that enables websites to expose reliable, auditable, and privacy-preserving capabilities for AI agents through simple, declarative HTML elements. VOIX introduces <tool> and <context> tags, allowing developers to explicitly define available actions and relevant state, thereby creating a clear, machine-readable contract for agent behavior. This approach shifts control to the website developer while preserving user privacy by disconnecting the conversational interactions from the website. We evaluated the framework's practicality, learnability, and expressiveness in a three-day hackathon study with 16 developers. The results demonstrate that participants, regardless of prior experience, were able to rapidly build diverse and functional agent-enabled web applications. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational mechanism for realizing the Agentic Web, enabling a future of seamless and secure human-AI collaboration on the web.",human
"Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.",human
"Natural language data, such as text and speech, have become readily available through social networking services and chat platforms. By leveraging human observations expressed in natural language, this paper addresses the problem of state estimation for physical systems, in which humans act as sensing agents. To this end, we propose a Language-Aided Particle Filter (LAPF), a particle filter framework that structures human observations via natural language processing and incorporates them into the update step of the state estimation. Finally, the LAPF is applied to the water level estimation problem in an irrigation canal and its effectiveness is demonstrated.",human
"Federated learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes distributed client resources while preserving data privacy. Most existing FL approaches assume clients possess labeled data, however, in real-world scenarios, client-side labels are often unavailable. Semi-supervised Federated learning, where only the server holds labeled data, addresses this issue. However, it experiences significant performance degradation as the number of labeled data decreases. To tackle this problem, we propose \textit{CATCHFed}, which introduces client-aware adaptive thresholds considering class difficulty, hybrid thresholds to enhance pseudo-label quality, and utilizes unpseudo-labeled data for consistency regularization. Extensive experiments across various datasets and configurations demonstrate that CATCHFed effectively leverages unlabeled client data, achieving superior performance even in extremely limited-label settings.",human
"We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type ""Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?"". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.",human
"An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.   This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.",human
"Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics. The dataset is publicly available on ZENODO (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17566690).",human
"Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.",human
"The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.",human
"The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.",human
"Autonomous aerial systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for mission planning, perception, and decision-making, yet the lack of standardized and physically grounded benchmarks limits systematic evaluation of their reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the UAVBench dataset, the UAVBench_MCQ benchmark, evaluation scripts, and all related materials on GitHub at https://github.com/maferrag/UAVBench",human
"Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.",human
"The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.",human
"Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.",human
"We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.",human
"This paper investigates neural network-based biometric authentication using finger-drawn digits on touchscreen devices. We evaluated CNN and autoencoder architectures for user authentication through simple digit patterns (0-9) traced with finger input. Twenty participants contributed 2,000 finger-drawn digits each on personal touchscreen devices. We compared two CNN architectures: a modified Inception-V1 network and a lightweight shallow CNN for mobile environments. Additionally, we examined Convolutional and Fully Connected autoencoders for anomaly detection. Both CNN architectures achieved ~89% authentication accuracy, with the shallow CNN requiring fewer parameters. Autoencoder approaches achieved ~75% accuracy. The results demonstrate that finger-drawn symbol authentication provides a viable, secure, and user-friendly biometric solution for touchscreen devices. This approach can be integrated with existing pattern-based authentication methods to create multi-layered security systems for mobile applications.",human
"Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.",human
"Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.",human
"High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.",human
"Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are versatile detectors that reconstruct charged-particle tracks in an ionizing medium, enabling sensitive measurements across a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $β$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data. Together, these results highlight the potential of sparse convolutional techniques as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments.",human
"WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.",human

"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.",human
"Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.",human
"We study how two information feeds, a closed-form Markov estimator of residual sojourn and an online trained actor-critic, affect reneging and jockeying in a dual M/M/1 system. Analytically, for unequal service rates and total-time patience, we show that total wait grows linearly so abandonment is inevitable and the probability of a successful jockey vanishes as the backlog approaches towards infinity. Furthermore, under a mild sub-linear error condition both information models yield the same asymptotic limits (robustness). We empirically validate these limits and quantify finite backlog differences. Our findings show that learned and analytic feeds produce different delays, reneging rates and transient jockeying behavior at practical sizes, but converge to the same asymptotic outcome implied by our theory. The results characterize when value-of-information matters (finite regimes) and when it does not (asymptotics), informing lightweight telemetry and decision-logic design for low-cost, jockeying-aware systems.",human
"The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.",human
"Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like ""Who is Undercover?"". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting ""undercover"" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.",human
"The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.",human
"Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.",human
"The growing popularity of group activities increased the need to develop methods for providing recommendations to a group of users based on the collective preferences of the group members. Several group recommender systems have been proposed, but these methods often struggle due to sparsity and high-dimensionality of the available data, common in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our method recovers lower matrix ranks than the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.",human
"This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.",human
"In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.",human
This article reviews modern optimization methods for training neural networks with an emphasis on efficiency and scale. We present state-of-the-art optimization algorithms under a unified algorithmic template that highlights the importance of adapting to the structures in the problem. We then cover how to make these algorithms agnostic to the scale of the problem. Our exposition is intended as an introduction for both practitioners and researchers who wish to be involved in these exciting new developments.,human
"The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.",human
"This paper addresses the nonparametric estimation of the drift function over a compact domain for a time-homogeneous diffusion process, based on high-frequency discrete observations from $N$ independent trajectories. We propose a neural network-based estimator and derive a non-asymptotic convergence rate, decomposed into a training error, an approximation error, and a diffusion-related term scaling as ${\log N}/{N}$. For compositional drift functions, we establish an explicit rate. In the numerical experiments, we consider a drift function with local fluctuations generated by a double-layer compositional structure featuring local oscillations, and show that the empirical convergence rate becomes independent of the input dimension $d$. Compared to the $B$-spline method, the neural network estimator achieves better convergence rates and more effectively captures local features, particularly in higher-dimensional settings.",human
"Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.",human
"Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.",human
"Although LLM training is typically centralized with high-bandwidth interconnects and large compute budgets, emerging methods target communication-constrained training in distributed environments. The model trade-offs introduced by this shift remain underexplored, and our goal is to study them.   We use the open-source nanochat project, a compact 8K-line full-stack ChatGPT-like implementation containing tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, and serving, as a controlled baseline. We implement the DiLoCo algorithm as a lightweight wrapper over nanochat's training loop, performing multiple local steps per worker before synchronization with an outer optimizer, effectively reducing communication by orders of magnitude. This inner-outer training is compared against a standard data-parallel (DDP) setup. Because nanochat is small and inspectable, it enables controlled pipeline adaptations and allows direct comparison with the conventional centralized baseline.   DiLoCo achieves stable convergence and competitive loss in pretraining but yields worse MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval scores after mid-training and SFT. We discover that using DiLoCo-pretrained weights and running mid- and post-training with DDP fails to recover performance, revealing irreversible representation drift from asynchronous updates that impairs downstream alignment. We provide this implementation as an official fork of nanochat on GitHub.",human
"Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.",human
"Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.",human
"This paper presents the AR fairness metamodel, aimed at formally representing, analyzing, and comparing fairness scenarios. The metamodel provides an abstract representation of fairness, enabling the formal definition of fairness notions. We instantiate the metamodel through several examples, with a particular focus on comparing the notions of equity and equality.   We use the Tiles framework, which offers modular components that can be interconnected to represent various definitions of fairness. Its primary objective is to support the operationalization of AR-based fairness definitions in a range of scenarios, providing a robust method for defining, comparing, and evaluating fairness.   Tiles has an open-source implementation for fairness modeling and evaluation.",human
"Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.",human
"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a widely used multimodal model that aligns text and image representations through large-scale training. While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.",human
"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.",human
"We propose a framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by combining perturbation theory with one-shot transfer learning in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Nonlinear PDEs with polynomial terms are decomposed into a sequence of linear subproblems, which are efficiently solved using a Multi-Head PINN. Once the latent representation of the linear operator is learned, solutions to new PDE instances with varying perturbations, forcing terms, or boundary/initial conditions can be obtained in closed form without retraining.   We validate the method on KPP-Fisher and wave equations, achieving errors on the order of 1e-3 while adapting to new problem instances in under 0.2 seconds; comparable accuracy to classical solvers but with faster transfer. Sensitivity analyses show predictable error growth with epsilon and polynomial degree, clarifying the method's effective regime.   Our contributions are: (i) extending one-shot transfer learning from nonlinear ODEs to PDEs, (ii) deriving a closed-form solution for adapting to new PDE instances, and (iii) demonstrating accuracy and efficiency on canonical nonlinear PDEs. We conclude by outlining extensions to derivative-dependent nonlinearities and higher-dimensional PDEs.",human
"The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems. Project website: https://opendatalab-raiser.github.io/GGBench/.",human
"With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU. Our code is available at https://github.com/singing-cat/MemoDetector.",human
"How to best use Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering is covered in many publications in recent years. However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, is still underexplored. Within this paper, we study enterprises can achieve on their own without investing large amounts of effort into the training of models specific to the domain-specific languages that are used. We show that few-shot prompting approaches are sufficient to solve simple problems in a language that is otherwise not well-supported by an LLM and that is possible on-premise, thereby ensuring the protection of sensitive company data.",human
"Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.",human
"Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.",human
"Benchmarks such as ARC, Raven-inspired tests, and the Blackbird Task are widely used to evaluate the intelligence of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks.",human
"Formative feedback is widely recognized as one of the most effective drivers of student learning, yet it remains difficult to implement equitably at scale. In large or low-resource courses, instructors often lack the time, staffing, and bandwidth required to review and respond to every student reflection, creating gaps in support precisely where learners would benefit most. This paper presents a theory-grounded system that uses five coordinated role-based LLM agents (Evaluator, Equity Monitor, Metacognitive Coach, Aggregator, and Reflexion Reviewer) to score learner reflections with a shared rubric and to generate short, bias-aware, learner-facing comments. The agents first produce structured rubric scores, then check for potentially biased or exclusionary language, add metacognitive prompts that invite students to think about their own thinking, and finally compose a concise feedback message of at most 120 words. The system includes simple fairness checks that compare scoring error across lower and higher scoring learners, enabling instructors to monitor and bound disparities in accuracy. We evaluate the pipeline in a 12-session AI literacy program with adult learners. In this setting, the system produces rubric scores that approach expert-level agreement, and trained graders rate the AI-generated comments as helpful, empathetic, and well aligned with instructional goals. Taken together, these results show that multi-agent LLM systems can deliver equitable, high-quality formative feedback at a scale and speed that would be impossible for human graders alone. More broadly, the work points toward a future where feedback-rich learning becomes feasible for any course size or context, advancing long-standing goals of equity, access, and instructional capacity in education.",human
"Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.",human
"The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.",human
"Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.",human
"Instruction-guided text-to-speech (TTS) research has reached a maturity level where excellent speech generation quality is possible on demand, yet two coupled biases persist: accent bias, where models default to dominant phonetic patterns, and linguistic bias, where dialect-specific lexical and cultural cues are ignored. These biases are interdependent, as authentic accent generation requires both accent fidelity and localized text. We present Contextual Linguistic Adaptation and Retrieval for Inclusive TTS sYnthesis (CLARITY), a backbone-agnostic framework that addresses these biases through dual-signal optimization: (i) contextual linguistic adaptation that localizes input text to the target dialect, and (ii) retrieval-augmented accent prompting (RAAP) that supplies accent-consistent speech prompts. Across twelve English accents, CLARITY improves accent accuracy and fairness while maintaining strong perceptual quality.",human
"Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.",human
"Predictive coding (PC) replaces global backpropagation with local optimization over weights and activations. We show that linear PC networks admit a natural formulation as cellular sheaves: the sheaf coboundary maps activations to edge-wise prediction errors, and PC inference is diffusion under the sheaf Laplacian. Sheaf cohomology then characterizes irreducible error patterns that inference cannot remove. We analyze recurrent topologies where feedback loops create internal contradictions, introducing prediction errors unrelated to supervision. Using a Hodge decomposition, we determine when these contradictions cause learning to stall. The sheaf formalism provides both diagnostic tools for identifying problematic network configurations and design principles for effective weight initialization for recurrent PC networks.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.",human
"Zero-shot coordination(ZSC), a key challenge in multi-agent game theory, has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning (RL) research recently, especially in complex evolving games. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators from a diverse, potentially evolving, pool of partners that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training, which approximates such an evolving partner pool, has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient RL training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi cooperative game and confirms its superiority.",human
"Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.",human
"We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.",human
"Generating complex, logically-sound SPARQL queries for multi-hop questions remains a critical bottleneck for Knowledge Graph Question Answering, as the brittle nature of one-shot generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) hinders reliable interaction with structured data. Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs.",human
"Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.",human
"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.",human
"Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.",human
"Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models",human
"Molecular property prediction is fundamental to chemical engineering applications such as solvent screening. We present Socrates-Mol, a framework that transforms language models into empirical Bayesian reasoners through context engineering, addressing cold start problems without model fine-tuning. The system implements a reflective-prediction cycle where initial outputs serve as priors, retrieved molecular cases provide evidence, and refined predictions form posteriors, extracting reusable chemical rules from sparse data. We introduce ranking tasks aligned with industrial screening priorities and employ cross-model self-consistency across five language models to reduce variance. Experiments on amine solvent LogP prediction reveal task-dependent patterns: regression achieves 72% MAE reduction and 112% R-squared improvement through self-consistency, while ranking tasks show limited gains due to systematic multi-model biases. The framework reduces deployment costs by over 70% compared to full fine-tuning, providing a scalable solution for molecular property prediction while elucidating the task-adaptive nature of self-consistency mechanisms.",human
"4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.",human
"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.",human
"Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.",human
"We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.",human
"Despite recent advances in fairness-aware machine learning, predictive models often exhibit discriminatory behavior towards marginalized groups. Such unfairness might arise from biased training data, model design, or representational disparities across groups, posing significant challenges in high-stakes decision-making domains such as college admissions. While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. To circumvent these issues, we propose integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach facilitates stable adversarial learning. We derive theoretical insights into the spline-based KAN architecture that ensure stability during adversarial optimization. Additionally, an adaptive fairness penalty update mechanism is proposed to strike a balance between fairness and accuracy. We back these findings with empirical evidence on two real-world admissions datasets, demonstrating the proposed framework's efficiency in achieving fairness across sensitive attributes while preserving predictive performance.",human
"Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, ""Truth Last"", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.",human
"With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.",human
"Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.",human
"Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.",human
"In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to ""break"" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).",human
"Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.",human
"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.",human
"Healthcare AI systems face major vulnerabilities to data poisoning that current defenses and regulations cannot adequately address. We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach. Current regulations lack mandatory adversarial robustness testing, and federated learning can worsen risks by obscuring attribution. We recommend multilayer defenses including required adversarial testing, ensemble-based detection, privacy-preserving security mechanisms, and international coordination on AI security standards. We also question whether opaque black-box models are suitable for high-stakes clinical decisions, suggesting a shift toward interpretable systems with verifiable safety guarantees.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.",human
"The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.",human
"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.",human
"Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a ""visual processing bottleneck"": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.",human
"Audio classification plays an essential role in sentiment analysis and emotion recognition, especially for analyzing customer attitudes in marketing phone calls.

Evaluations conducted on our proprietary MarketCalls dataset, as well as established benchmarks (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and MELD), show MSMT-FN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our newly curated MarketCalls dataset will be available upon request, and the code base is made accessible at GitHub Repository MSMT-FN, to facilitate further research and advancements in audio classification domain.",human
"Recognizing speaker intent in long audio dialogues among speakers has a wide range of applications, but is a non-trivial AI task due to complex inter-dependencies in speaker utterances and scarce annotated data. To address these challenges, an end-to-end framework, namely DialogGraph-LLM, is proposed in the current work. DialogGraph-LLM combines a novel Multi-Relational Dialogue Attention Network (MR-DAN) architecture with multimodal foundation models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Omni-7B) for direct acoustic-to-intent inference. An adaptive semi-supervised learning strategy is designed using LLM with a confidence-aware pseudo-label generation mechanism based on dual-threshold filtering using both global and class confidences, and an entropy-based sample selection process that prioritizes high-information unlabeled instances. Extensive evaluations on the proprietary MarketCalls corpus and the publicly available MIntRec 2.0 benchmark demonstrate DialogGraph-LLM's superiority over strong audio and text-driven baselines. The framework demonstrates strong performance and efficiency in intent recognition in real world scenario audio dialogues, proving its practical value for audio-rich domains with limited supervision.

"Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.",human
"Intraoperative monitoring and prediction of vital signs are critical for ensuring patient safety and improving surgical outcomes. Despite recent advances in deep learning models for medical time-series forecasting, several challenges persist, including the lack of standardized benchmarks, incomplete data, and limited cross-center validation. To address these challenges, we introduce VitalBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for intraoperative vital sign prediction. VitalBench includes data from over 4,000 surgeries across two independent medical centers, offering three evaluation tracks: complete data, incomplete data, and cross-center generalization. This framework reflects the real-world complexities of clinical practice, minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and incorporating masked loss techniques for robust and unbiased model evaluation. By providing a standardized and unified platform for model development and comparison, VitalBench enables researchers to focus on architectural innovation while ensuring consistency in data handling. This work lays the foundation for advancing predictive models for intraoperative vital sign forecasting, ensuring that these models are not only accurate but also robust and adaptable across diverse clinical environments.

"Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.",human
"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is vulnerable to real-world data corruption, with even robust algorithms failing under challenging observation and mixture corruptions. We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions. We integrate SAM into strong baselines for data corruption: IQL, a top-performing offline RL algorithm in this setting, and RIQL, an algorithm designed specifically for data-corruption robustness. We evaluate them on D4RL benchmarks with both random and adversarial corruption. Our SAM-enhanced methods consistently and significantly outperform the original baselines. Visualizations of the reward surface confirm that SAM finds smoother solutions, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness in improving the robustness of offline RL agents.",human
"The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.",human
"Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.",human
"We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.",human
"Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.",human
"Machine Learning (ML) models are being increasingly employed for credit risk evaluation, with their effectiveness largely hinging on the quality of the input data. In this paper we investigate the impact of several data quality issues, including missing values, noisy attributes, outliers, and label errors, on the predictive accuracy of the machine learning model used in credit risk assessment. Utilizing an open-source dataset, we introduce controlled data corruption using the Pucktrick library to assess the robustness of 10 frequently used models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression and so on. Our experiments show significant differences in model robustness based on the nature and severity of the data degradation. Moreover, the proposed methodology and accompanying tools offer practical support for practitioners seeking to enhance data pipeline robustness, and provide researchers with a flexible framework for further experimentation in data-centric AI contexts.",human
"Weight quantization in spiking neural networks (SNNs) could further reduce energy consumption. However, quantizing weights without sacrificing accuracy remains challenging. In this study, inspired by astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation in the biological nervous systems, we propose Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ), which incorporates weight quantization with temporal dynamics to adaptively allocate ultra-low-bit weights along the temporal dimension. Extensive experiments on static (e.g., ImageNet) and neuromorphic (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate that our TaWQ maintains high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) while incurring a negligible quantization loss of only 0.22% on ImageNet.",human
"Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.",human
"Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/xia-zhe/RedReg.git",human
"We transitioned our post-CS1 course that introduces various subfields of computer science so that it integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) in a structured, critical, and practical manner. It aims to help students develop the skills needed to engage meaningfully and responsibly with AI. The course now includes explicit instruction on how LLMs work, exposure to current tools, ethical issues, and activities that encourage student reflection on personal use of LLMs as well as the larger evolving landscape of AI-assisted programming. In class, we demonstrate the use and verification of LLM outputs, guide students in the use of LLMs as an ingredient in a larger problem-solving loop, and require students to disclose and acknowledge the nature and extent of LLM assistance. Throughout the course, we discuss risks and benefits of LLMs across CS subfields. In our first iteration of the course, we collected and analyzed data from students pre and post surveys. Student understanding of how LLMs work became more technical, and their verification and use of LLMs shifted to be more discerning and collaborative. These strategies can be used in other courses to prepare students for the AI-integrated future.",human
"Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual ""knowledge"" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.",human
"LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.

"Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.",human
"Diffusion model (DM)-based channel estimation, which generates channel samples via a posteriori sampling stepwise with denoising process, has shown potential in high-precision channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme. Meanwhile, it achieves superior channel estimation accuracy under different channel conditions.",human
"Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.",human
"Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with ""the right to be forgotten"" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.",human
"Brain-computer interface (BCI) speech decoding has emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals with speech impairments. In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications.",human
"Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.",human
"Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.",human
"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.",human
"Root cause analysis in microservice systems typically involves two core tasks: root cause localization (RCL) and failure type identification (FTI). Despite substantial research efforts, conventional diagnostic approaches still face two key challenges. First, these methods predominantly adopt a joint learning paradigm for RCL and FTI to exploit shared information and reduce training time. However, this simplistic integration neglects the causal dependencies between tasks, thereby impeding inter-task collaboration and information transfer. Second, these existing methods primarily focus on point-to-point relationships between instances, overlooking the group nature of inter-instance influences induced by deployment configurations and load balancing. To overcome these limitations, we propose CCLH, a novel root cause analysis framework that orchestrates diagnostic tasks based on cascaded conditional learning. CCLH provides a three-level taxonomy for group influences between instances and incorporates a heterogeneous hypergraph to model these relationships, facilitating the simulation of failure propagation. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from three microservice benchmarks demonstrate that CCLH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both RCL and FTI.",human
"Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning presents unique challenges due to the lack of explicitly labeled negative samples, particularly in high-stakes domains such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis. To address data scarcity and privacy constraints, we propose a novel transfer learning with model averaging framework that integrates information from heterogeneous data sources - including fully binary labeled, semi-supervised, and PU data sets - without direct data sharing. For each source domain type, a tailored logistic regression model is conducted, and knowledge is transferred to the PU target domain through model averaging. Optimal weights for combining source models are determined via a cross-validation criterion that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We establish theoretical guarantees for weight optimality and convergence, covering both misspecified and correctly specified target models, with further extensions to high-dimensional settings using sparsity-penalized estimators. Extensive simulations and real-world credit risk data analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparative methods in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness, especially under limited labeled data and heterogeneous environments.",human
"Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.",human
"Modern text-to-speech (TTS) systems, particularly those built on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), generate high-fidelity speech that faithfully reproduces input text and mimics specified speaker identities. While prior misuse studies have focused on speaker impersonation, this work explores a distinct content-centric threat: exploiting TTS systems to produce speech containing harmful content. Realizing such threats poses two core challenges: (1) LALM safety alignment frequently rejects harmful prompts, yet existing jailbreak attacks are ill-suited for TTS because these systems are designed to faithfully vocalize any input text, and (2) real-world deployment pipelines often employ input/output filters that block harmful text and audio.   We present HARMGEN, a suite of five attacks organized into two families that address these challenges. The first family employs semantic obfuscation techniques (Concat, Shuffle) that conceal harmful content within text. The second leverages audio-modality exploits (Read, Spell, Phoneme) that inject harmful content through auxiliary audio channels while maintaining benign textual prompts. Through evaluation across five commercial LALMs-based TTS systems and three datasets spanning two languages, we demonstrate that our attacks substantially reduce refusal rates and increase the toxicity of generated speech.   We further assess both reactive countermeasures deployed by audio-streaming platforms and proactive defenses implemented by TTS providers. Our analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities: deepfake detectors underperform on high-fidelity audio; reactive moderation can be circumvented by adversarial perturbations; while proactive moderation detects 57-93% of attacks. Our work highlights a previously underexplored content-centric misuse vector for TTS and underscore the need for robust cross-modal safeguards throughout training and deployment.",human
"We introduce the Sumudu Neural Operator (SNO), a neural operator rooted in the properties of the Sumudu Transform. We leverage the relationship between the polynomial expansions of transform pairs to decompose the input space as coefficients, which are then transformed into the Sumudu Space, where the neural operator is parameterized. We evaluate the operator in ODEs (Duffing Oscillator, Lorenz System, and Driven Pendulum) and PDEs (Euler-Bernoulli Beam, Burger's Equation, Diffusion, Diffusion-Reaction, and Brusselator). SNO achieves superior performance to FNO on PDEs and demonstrates competitive accuracy with LNO on several PDE tasks, including the lowest error on the Euler-Bernoulli Beam and Diffusion Equation. Additionally, we apply zero-shot super-resolution to the PDE tasks to observe the model's capability of obtaining higher quality data from low-quality samples. These preliminary findings suggest promise for the Sumudu Transform as a neural operator design, particularly for certain classes of PDEs.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities across diverse domains, yet their performance on rare disease diagnosis from narrative medical cases remains underexplored. We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.",human
"The rapidly growing computation demands of deep neural networks (DNNs) have driven hardware vendors to integrate matrix multiplication accelerators (MMAs), such as NVIDIA Tensor Cores and AMD Matrix Cores, into modern GPUs. However, due to distinct and undocumented arithmetic specifications for floating-point matrix multiplication, some MMAs can lead to numerical imprecision and inconsistency that can compromise the stability and reproducibility of DNN training and inference.   This paper presents MMA-Sim, the first bit-accurate reference model that reveals the detailed arithmetic behaviors of the MMAs from ten GPU architectures (eight from NVIDIA and two from AMD). By dissecting the MMAs using a combination of targeted and randomized tests, our methodology derives nine arithmetic algorithms to simulate the floating-point matrix multiplication of the MMAs. Large-scale validation confirms bitwise equivalence between MMA-Sim and the real hardware. Using MMA-Sim, we investigate arithmetic behaviors that affect DNN training stability, and identify undocumented behaviors that could lead to significant errors.",human
"Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.",human
"This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.",human
"While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating academic workflows, existing systems for academic peer review remain constrained by text-only inputs, limited contextual grounding, and a lack of actionable feedback. In this work, we present an interactive web-based system for multimodal, community-aware peer review simulation to enable effective manuscript revisions before paper submission. Our framework integrates textual and visual information through multimodal LLMs, enhances review quality via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounded in web-scale OpenReview data, and converts generated reviews into actionable to-do lists using the proposed Action:Objective[\#] format, providing structured and traceable guidance. The system integrates seamlessly into existing academic writing platforms, providing interactive interfaces for real-time feedback and revision tracking. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating more comprehensive and useful reviews aligned with expert standards, surpassing ablated baselines and advancing transparent, human-centered scholarly assistance.",human
"Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.",human
"Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

"Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and winter storms have induced large-scale power outages in the U.S., resulting in tremendous economic and societal impacts. Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states. The model exhibits an excellent performance ($>93\%$ accuracy) and outperforms the existing methods XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN and simple GAT by $2\% - 15\%$ in both the overall performance and class-wise accuracy.",human
"Despite remarkable advancements in supervised pansharpening neural networks, these methods face domain adaptation challenges of resolution due to the intrinsic disparity between simulated reduced-resolution training data and real-world full-resolution scenarios.To bridge this gap, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening framework, CLIPPan, that enables model training at full resolution directly by taking CLIP, a visual-language model, as a supervisor. However, directly applying CLIP to supervise pansharpening remains challenging due to its inherent bias toward natural images and limited understanding of pansharpening tasks. Therefore, we first introduce a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline that adapts CLIP to recognize low-resolution multispectral, panchromatic, and high-resolution multispectral images, as well as to understand the pansharpening process. Then, building on the adapted CLIP, we formulate a novel \textit{loss integrating semantic language constraints}, which aligns image-level fusion transitions with protocol-aligned textual prompts (e.g., Wald's or Khan's descriptions), thus enabling CLIPPan to use language as a powerful supervisory signal and guide fusion learning without ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening.",human
"This paper proposes a competitive and computationally efficient approach to probabilistic rainfall nowcasting.

The projector-head is optimized end-to-end over the Ranked Probability Score (RPS). As an alternative, 3D-UNET baselines trained with an aggregate Rank Probability Score and a per-pixel Gamma-Hurdle objective are used.

Models are trained with 10-fold splits and evaluated with SMILES test-time augmentation. The approach ranks 9th of 2241 teams in the Open Polymer Prediction Challenge at NeurIPS 2025.

"Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.",human
"Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.",human
"Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.",human
"A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.",human
"Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an ""I don't know"" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.",human
"Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.",human
"Context: Ensuring high levels of dependability in modern computer-based systems has become increasingly challenging due to their complexity. Although systems are validated at design time, their behavior can be different at run-time, possibly showing control-flow anomalies due to ""unknown unknowns"".   Objective: We aim to detect control-flow anomalies through software monitoring, which verifies run-time behavior by logging software execution and detecting deviations from expected control flow.   Methods: We propose a methodology to develop software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through Large Language Models (LLMs) and conformance checking. The methodology builds on existing software development practices to maintain traditional V&V while providing an additional level of robustness and trustworthiness. It leverages LLMs to link design-time models and implementation code, automating source-code instrumentation. The resulting event logs are analyzed via conformance checking, an explainable and effective technique for control-flow anomaly detection.   Results: We test the methodology on a case-study scenario from the European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS), which is a railway standard for modern interoperable railways. The results obtained from the ERTMS/ETCS case study demonstrate that LLM-based source-code instrumentation can achieve up to 84.775% control-flow coverage of the reference design-time process model, while the subsequent conformance checking-based anomaly detection reaches a peak performance of 96.610% F1-score and 93.515% AUC.   Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to guide LLMs in source-code instrumentation significantly allowed obtaining reliable and quality software logs and enabled effective control-flow anomaly detection through conformance checking.",human
"The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.",human
"LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from ""Is this statement correct?"" to ""Is this speaker correct?"". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal (""The previous answer is incorrect."") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.",human
"Training data imbalance poses a major challenge for code LLMs. Most available data heavily over represents raw opensource code while underrepresenting broader software engineering tasks, especially in low resource languages like Golang. As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.",human
"This paper proposes a Short-Window Sliding Learning framework for real-time violence detection in CCTV footages. Unlike conventional long-video training approaches, the proposed method divides videos into 1-2 second clips and applies Large Language Model (LLM)-based auto-caption labeling to construct fine-grained datasets. Each short clip fully utilizes all frames to preserve temporal continuity, enabling precise recognition of rapid violent events. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 95.25\% accuracy on RWF-2000 and significantly improves performance on long videos (UCF-Crime: 83.25\%), confirming its strong generalization and real-time applicability in intelligent surveillance systems.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to plan, reason, and execute tasks across diverse scenarios. In use cases like repeatable workflows and agentic settings, prompts are often reused with minor variations while having a similar structure for recurring tasks. This opens up opportunities for caching. However, exact prompt matching fails on such structurally similar prompts, while semantic caching may produce incorrect responses by ignoring critical differences. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod{}, a generative cache that produces variation-aware responses for structurally similar prompts. \ourmethod{} identifies reusable response patterns across similar prompt structures and synthesizes customized outputs for new requests. We show that \ourmethod{} achieves 83\% cache hit rate, while having minimal incorrect hits on datasets without prompt repetition. In agentic workflows, it improves cache hit rate by $\sim$20\% and reduces end-to-end execution latency by $\sim$34\% compared to standard prompt matching.",human
"Newsrooms and journalists across the world are adopting Generative AI (GenAI). Drawing on in-depth interviews with 23 journalists, this study identifies Bangladeshi journalists' awareness, acceptance, usage patterns, and their media organizations' stance toward GenAI. This study finds Bangladeshi journalists' high reliance on GenAI like their Western colleagues despite limited institutional support and the near absence of AI policy. Despite this contrast, concerns over GenAI's implications in journalism between the West and non-West were mostly identical. Moreover, this study contributes to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by proposing two changes regarding GenAI adoption among journalists in non-Western settings. First, this study identifies the non-contribution of facilitating conditions in shaping behavioral intent in GenAI adoption in non-Western contexts. Second, social influence works in a horizontal order through informal peer pressure or professional motivation in the absence of formal institutional hierarchical pressure. Voluntariness in the context of Bangladeshi journalists is underpinned by their professional compulsion. Therefore, this study contributes to understanding how contextual factors shape technology adoption trajectories in non-Western journalism.",human
"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.",human
"Unit testing in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is critical but challenged by parallelism, complex algorithms, and diverse hardware. Traditional methods often fail to address non-deterministic behavior and synchronization issues in HPC applications. This paper introduces HPCAgentTester, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to automate and enhance unit test generation for HPC software utilizing OpenMP and MPI. HPCAgentTester employs a unique collaborative workflow where specialized LLM agents (Recipe Agent and Test Agent) iteratively generate and refine test cases through a critique loop. This architecture enables the generation of context-aware unit tests that specifically target parallel execution constructs, complex communication patterns, and hierarchical parallelism. We demonstrate HPCAgentTester's ability to produce compilable and functionally correct tests for OpenMP and MPI primitives, effectively identifying subtle bugs that are often missed by conventional techniques. Our evaluation shows that HPCAgentTester significantly improves test compilation rates and correctness compared to standalone LLMs, offering a more robust and scalable solution for ensuring the reliability of parallel software systems.",human
"One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.",human
"Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.",human
"Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.",human
"Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.",human
"Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.",human
"Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.",human
"Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.",human
"We present an end-to-end demonstration of how attackers can exploit AI safety failures to harm vulnerable populations: from jailbreaking LLMs to generate phishing content, to deploying those messages against real targets, to successfully compromising elderly victims. We systematically evaluated safety guardrails across six frontier LLMs spanning four attack categories, revealing critical failures where several models exhibited near-complete susceptibility to certain attack vectors. In a human validation study with 108 senior volunteers, AI-generated phishing emails successfully compromised 11\% of participants. Our work uniquely demonstrates the complete attack pipeline targeting elderly populations, highlighting that current AI safety measures fail to protect those most vulnerable to fraud. Beyond generating phishing content, LLMs enable attackers to overcome language barriers and conduct multi-turn trust-building conversations at scale, fundamentally transforming fraud economics. While some providers report voluntary counter-abuse efforts, we argue these remain insufficient.",human
"Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed ""silver"" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.",human
"Communication networks are essential for our economy and our everyday lives. This makes them lucrative targets for attacks. Today, we see an ongoing battle between criminals that try to disrupt our key communication networks and security professionals that try to mitigate these attacks. However, today's networks, like the Internet or peer-to-peer networks among smart devices, are not controlled by a single authority, but instead consist of many independently administrated entities that are interconnected. Thus, both the decisions of how to interconnect and how to secure against potential attacks are taken in a decentralized way by selfish agents.   This strategic setting, with agents that want to interconnect and potential attackers that want to disrupt the network, was captured via an influential game-theoretic model by Goyal, Jabbari, Kearns, Khanna, and Morgenstern (WINE 2016). We revisit this model and show improved tight bounds on the achieved robustness of networks created by selfish agents. As our main result, we show that such networks can resist attacks of a large class of potential attackers, i.e., these networks maintain asymptotically optimal welfare post attack. This improves several bounds and resolves an open problem. Along the way, we show the counter-intuitive result, that attackers that aim at minimizing the social welfare post attack do not actually inflict the greatest possible damage.",human
"Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.",human
"Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.",human
"Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.",human
"Protein structure is central to biological function, and enabling multimodal protein models requires joint reasoning over sequence, structure, and function. A key barrier is the lack of principled protein structure tokenizers (PSTs): existing approaches fix token size or rely on continuous vector codebooks, limiting interpretability, multi-scale control, and transfer across architectures. We introduce GeoBPE, a geometry-grounded PST that transforms continuous, noisy, multi-scale backbone conformations into discrete ``sentences'' of geometry while enforcing global constraints. Analogous to byte-pair encoding, GeoBPE generates a hierarchical vocabulary of geometric primitives by iteratively (i) clustering Geo-Pair occurrences with k-medoids to yield a resolution-controllable vocabulary; (ii) quantizing each Geo-Pair to its closest medoid prototype; and (iii) reducing drift through differentiable inverse kinematics that optimizes boundary glue angles under an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ end-frame loss. GeoBPE offers compression ($>$10x reduction in bits-per-residue at similar distortion rate), data efficiency ($>$10x less training data), and generalization (maintains test/train distortion ratio of $1.0-1.1$). It is architecture-agnostic: (a) its hierarchical vocabulary provides a strong inductive bias for coarsening residue-level embeddings from large PLMs into motif- and protein-level representations, consistently outperforming leading PSTs across $12$ tasks and $24$ test splits; (b) paired with a transformer, GeoBPE supports unconditional backbone generation via language modeling; and (c) tokens align with CATH functional families and support expert-interpretable case studies, offering functional meaning absent in prior PSTs. Code is available at https://github.com/shiningsunnyday/PT-BPE/.",human
"Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.",human
"Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.",human
"Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench",human
"Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.",human
"Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.",human
"Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.   We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.",human
"Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small and carefully crafted inputs that lead to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.   We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.",human
"We study the estimation problem of distribution-on-distribution regression, where both predictors and responses are probability measures. Existing approaches typically rely on a global optimal transport map or tangent-space linearization, which can be restrictive in approximation capacity and distort geometry in multivariate underlying domains. In this paper, we propose the \emph{Neural Local Wasserstein Regression}, a flexible nonparametric framework that models regression through locally defined transport maps in Wasserstein space. Our method builds on the analogy with classical kernel regression: kernel weights based on the 2-Wasserstein distance localize estimators around reference measures, while neural networks parameterize transport operators that adapt flexibly to complex data geometries. This localized perspective broadens the class of admissible transformations and avoids the limitations of global map assumptions and linearization structures. We develop a practical training procedure using DeepSets-style architectures and Sinkhorn-approximated losses, combined with a greedy reference selection strategy for scalability. Through synthetic experiments on Gaussian and mixture models, as well as distributional prediction tasks on MNIST, we demonstrate that our approach effectively captures nonlinear and high-dimensional distributional relationships that elude existing methods.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.",human
"Research on how the popularization of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools impacts learning environments has led to hesitancy among educators to teach these tools in classrooms, creating two observed disconnects. Generative AI competency is increasingly valued in industry but not in higher education, and students are experimenting with generative AI without formal guidance. The authors argue students across fields must be taught to responsibly and expertly harness the potential of AI tools to ensure job market readiness and positive outcomes. Computer Science trajectories are particularly impacted, and while consistently top ranked U.S. Computer Science departments teach the mechanisms and frameworks underlying AI, few appear to offer courses on applications for existing generative AI tools. A course was developed at a private research university to teach undergraduate and graduate Computer Science students applications for generative AI tools in software development. Two mixed method surveys indicated students overwhelmingly found the course valuable and effective. Co-authored by the instructor and one of the graduate students, this paper explores the context, implementation, and impact of the course through data analysis and reflections from both perspectives. It additionally offers recommendations for replication in and beyond Computer Science departments. This is the extended version of this paper to include technical appendices.",human
"We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.",human
"Operational safety at mission-critical work sites is a top priority given the complex and hazardous nature of daily tasks. This paper presents the Human-Agent Risk Navigation and Event Safety System (HARNESS), a modular AI framework designed to forecast hazardous events and analyze operational risks in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) environments. HARNESS integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured work data, historical event retrieval, and risk analysis to proactively identify potential hazards. A human-in-the-loop mechanism allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine predictions, creating an adaptive learning loop that enhances performance over time. By combining SME collaboration with iterative agentic reasoning, HARNESS improves the reliability and efficiency of predictive safety systems. Preliminary deployment shows promising results, with future work focusing on quantitative evaluation of accuracy, SME agreement, and decision latency reduction.",human
"Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.",human
"We study a Stackelberg variant of the classical Most Vital Links problem, modeled as a one-round adversarial game between an attacker and a defender. The attacker strategically removes up to $k$ edges from a flow network to maximally disrupt flow between a source $s$ and a sink $t$, after which the defender optimally reroutes the remaining flow. To capture this attacker--defender interaction, we introduce a new mathematical model of discounted cuts, in which the cost of a cut is evaluated by excluding its $k$ most expensive edges. This model generalizes the Most Vital Links problem and uncovers novel algorithmic and complexity-theoretic properties.   We develop a unified algorithmic framework for analyzing various forms of discounted cut problems, including minimizing or maximizing the cost of a cut under discount mechanisms that exclude either the $k$ most expensive or the $k$ cheapest edges. While most variants are NP-complete on general graphs, our main result establishes polynomial-time solvability for all discounted cut problems in our framework when the input is restricted to bounded-genus graphs, a relevant class that includes many real-world networks such as transportation and infrastructure networks. With this work, we aim to open collaborative bridges between artificial intelligence, algorithmic game theory, and operations research.",human
"This study presents a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for classifying transient astronomical object light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. The original fourteen object classes were reorganized into five generalized categories (S-Like, Fast, Long, Periodic, and Non-Periodic) to address class imbalance. After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects. The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class. These findings indicate that class imbalance and limited temporal information are primary limitations, suggesting that class balancing strategies and preprocessing techniques focusing on detection moments could improve performance.",human
"The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.",human
"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.",human
"Students often report difficulties in accessing day-to-day academic information, which is usually spread across numerous institutional documents and websites. This fragmentation results in a lack of clarity and causes confusion about routine university information. This project proposes the development of a chatbot using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to simplify access to such information. Several GenAI models were tested and evaluated based on quality metrics and the LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Among them, Gemini 2.0 Flash stood out for its quality and speed, and Gemma 3n for its good performance and open-source nature.",human
"In this paper, we introduce TEDxTN, the first publicly available Tunisian Arabic to English speech translation dataset. This work is in line with the ongoing effort to mitigate the data scarcity obstacle for a number of Arabic dialects. We collected, segmented, transcribed and translated 108 TEDx talks following our internally developed annotations guidelines. The collected talks represent 25 hours of speech with code-switching that cover speakers with various accents from over 11 different regions of Tunisia. We make the annotation guidelines and corpus publicly available. This will enable the extension of TEDxTN to new talks as they become available. We also report results for strong baseline systems of Speech Recognition and Speech Translation using multiple pre-trained and fine-tuned end-to-end models. This corpus is the first open source and publicly available speech translation corpus of Code-Switching Tunisian dialect. We believe that this is a valuable resource that can motivate and facilitate further research on the natural language processing of Tunisian Dialect.",human
"Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.",human
"Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.",human
"Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.",human
"Systematic logistics, conveyance amenities and facilities as well as warehousing information play a key role in fostering profitable development in a supply chain. The aim of transformation in industries is the improvement of the resiliency regarding the supply chain. The resiliency policies are required for companies to affect the collaboration with logistics service providers positively. The decrement of air pollutant emissions is a persistent advantage of the efficient management of logistics and transportation in supply chain. The management of shipment type is a significant factor in analyzing the sustainability of logistics and supply chain. An automatic approach to predict the shipment type, logistics delay and traffic status are required to improve the efficiency of the supply chain management. A hybrid graphsage network (H-GSN) is proposed in this paper for multi-task purpose of logistics management in a supply chain. The shipment type, shipment status, traffic status, logistics ID and logistics delay are the objectives in this article regarding three different databases including DataCo, Shipping and Smart Logistcis available on Kaggle as supply chain logistics databases. The average accuracy of 97.8% and 100% are acquired for 10 kinds of logistics ID and 3 types of traffic status prediction in Smart Logistics dataset. The average accuracy of 98.7% and 99.4% are obtained for shipment type prediction in DataCo and logistics delay in Shipping database, respectively. The evaluation metrics for different logistics scenarios confirm the efficiency of the proposed method to improve the resilience and sustainability of the supply chain.",human
"Gradient-based optimization of engineering designs is limited by non-differentiable components in the typical computer-aided engineering (CAE) workflow, which calculates performance metrics from design parameters. While gradient-based methods could provide noticeable speed-ups in high-dimensional design spaces, codes for meshing, physical simulations, and other common components are not differentiable even if the math or physics underneath them is. We propose replacing non-differentiable pipeline components with surrogate models which are inherently differentiable. Using a toy example of aerodynamic shape optimization, we demonstrate an end-to-end differentiable pipeline where a 3D U-Net full-field surrogate replaces both meshing and simulation steps by training it on the mapping between the signed distance field (SDF) of the shape and the fields of interest. This approach enables gradient-based shape optimization without the need for differentiable solvers, which can be useful in situations where adjoint methods are unavailable and/or hard to implement.",human
"The Equivariant Quantum Circuit (EQC) for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been shown to achieve near-optimal performance in solving small TSP problems (up to 20 nodes) using only two parameters at depth 1. However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes. We provide a theoretical explanation for SIGS called the Size-Invariant Properties that goes beyond the concept of equivariance discussed in prior literature.",human
"Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.",human
"Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.",human
"Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.",human
"Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/sleeepeer/PISanitizer.",human
"Despite recent advances in robust locomotion, bipedal robots operating in the real world remain at risk of falling. While most research focuses on preventing such events, we instead concentrate on the phenomenon of falling itself. Specifically, we aim to reduce physical damage to the robot while providing users with control over a robot's end pose. To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses. Through simulated and real-world experiments, our work demonstrates that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.",human
"Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.",human
"Constrained non-convex optimization is fundamentally challenging, as global solutions are generally intractable and constraint qualifications may not hold. However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typically such transformations are implicit or unknown, making the direct link with the convex program impossible. On the other hand, (sub-)gradients with respect to the original variables are often accessible or can be easily estimated, which motivates algorithms that operate directly in the original (non-convex) problem space using standard (sub-)gradient oracles. In this work, we develop the first algorithms to provably solve such non-convex problems to global minima. First, using a modified inexact proximal point method, we establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ oracle complexity in non-smooth setting. For smooth problems, we propose a new bundle-level type method based on linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, improving the oracle complexity to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-1})$. Surprisingly, despite non-convexity, our methodology does not require any constraint qualifications, can handle hidden convex equality constraints, and achieves complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.",human
"The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.",human
"Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.",human
"Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.",human
"Internet measurement research faces an accessibility crisis: complex analyses require custom integration of multiple specialized tools that demands specialized domain expertise. When network disruptions occur, operators need rapid diagnostic workflows spanning infrastructure mapping, routing analysis, and dependency modeling. However, developing these workflows requires specialized knowledge and significant manual effort.   We present ArachNet, the first system demonstrating that LLM agents can independently generate measurement workflows that mimics expert reasoning. Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.",human
"Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.",human
"We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.",human
"The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.",human
"Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.",human
"The WikiRace game, where players navigate between Wikipedia articles using only hyperlinks, serves as a compelling benchmark for goal-directed search in complex information networks. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of navigation strategies for this task, comparing agents guided by graph-theoretic structure (betweenness centrality), semantic meaning (language model embeddings), and hybrid approaches. Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective. This strategy, when combined with a simple loop-avoidance mechanism, achieved a perfect success rate and navigated the network with an efficiency an order of magnitude better than structural or hybrid methods. Our findings highlight the critical limitations of purely structural heuristics for goal-directed search and underscore the transformative potential of large language models to act as powerful, zero-shot semantic navigators in complex information spaces.",human
"The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to ""overthinking"" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.",human
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in numerous fields of science, yet the initial research questions and targets are still almost always provided by human researchers. AI-generated creative ideas in science are rare and often vague, so that it remains a human task to execute them. Automating idea generation and implementation in one coherent system would significantly shift the role of humans in the scientific process. Here we present AI-Mandel, an LLM agent that can generate and implement ideas in quantum physics. AI-Mandel formulates ideas from the literature and uses a domain-specific AI tool to turn them into concrete experiment designs that can readily be implemented in laboratories. The generated ideas by AI-Mandel are often scientifically interesting - for two of them we have already written independent scientific follow-up papers. The ideas include new variations of quantum teleportation, primitives of quantum networks in indefinite causal orders, and new concepts of geometric phases based on closed loops of quantum information transfer. AI-Mandel is a prototypical demonstration of an AI physicist that can generate and implement concrete, actionable ideas. Building such a system is not only useful to accelerate science, but it also reveals concrete open challenges on the path to human-level artificial scientists.",human
"Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.",human
"Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.",human
"Modern vision-language models (VLMs) deliver impressive predictive accuracy yet offer little insight into 'why' a decision is reached, frequently hallucinating facts, particularly when encountering out-of-distribution data. Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.",human
"We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.   We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.",human
"Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.",human
"Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups. Our results highlight the potential of delay-aware, data-driven decision-making systems to improve institutional policy and social welfare.",human
"Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.",human
"Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.",human
"Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.",human
"Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.",human
"Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.",human
"Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.",human
"Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.   Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.",human
"Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.",human
"Using 2.6 billion geolocated social-media posts (2014-2022) and a fine-tuned generative language model, we construct county-level indicators of life satisfaction and happiness for the United States. We document an apparent rural-urban paradox: rural counties express higher life satisfaction while urban counties exhibit greater happiness. We reconcile this by treating the two as distinct layers of subjective well-being, evaluative vs. hedonic, showing that each maps differently onto place, politics, and time. Republican-leaning areas appear more satisfied in evaluative terms, but partisan gaps in happiness largely flatten outside major metros, indicating context-dependent political effects. Temporal shocks dominate the hedonic layer: happiness falls sharply during 2020-2022, whereas life satisfaction moves more modestly. These patterns are robust across logistic and OLS specifications and align with well-being theory. Interpreted as associations for the population of social-media posts, the results show that large-scale, language-based indicators can resolve conflicting findings about the rural-urban divide by distinguishing the type of well-being expressed, offering a transparent, reproducible complement to traditional surveys.",human
"Drift chambers have long been central to collider tracking, but future machines like a Higgs factory motivate higher granularity and cluster counting for particle ID, posing new data processing challenges. Machine learning (ML) at the ""edge"", or in cell-level readout, can dramatically reduce the off-detector data rate for high-granularity drift chambers by performing cluster counting at-source. We present machine learning algorithms for cluster counting in real-time readout of future drift chambers. These algorithms outperform traditional derivative-based techniques based on achievable pion-kaon separation. When synthesized to FPGA resources, they can achieve latencies consistent with real-time operation in a future Higgs factory scenario, thus advancing both R&D for future collider detectors as well as hardware-based ML for edge applications in high energy physics.",human
"Repetitive strain injury (RSI) affects roughly one in five computer users and remains largely unresolved despite decades of ergonomic mouse redesign. All such devices share a fundamental limitation: they still require fine-motor motion to operate. This work investigates whether predictive, AI-assisted input can reduce that motion by replacing physical pointing with ranked on-screen suggestions. To preserve user agency, we introduce Preview Accept Discard (PAD), a zero-click interaction paradigm that lets users preview predicted GUI targets, cycle through a small set of ranked alternatives, and accept or discard them via key-release timing. We evaluate PAD in two settings: a browser-based email client and a ISO 9241-9 keyboard-prediction task under varying top-3 accuracies. Across both studies, PAD substantially reduces hand motion relative to trackpad use while maintaining comparable task times with the trackpad only when accuracies are similar to those of the best spell-checkers.",human
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how research is conceived, conducted, and communicated across fields from chemistry to biomedicine. This commentary examines how AI is transforming the research workflow. AI systems now help researchers manage the information deluge, filtering the literature, surfacing cross-disciplinary links for ideas and collaborations, generating hypotheses, and designing and executing experiments. These developments mark a shift from AI as a mere computational tool to AI as an active collaborator in science. Yet this transformation demands thoughtful integration and governance. We argue that at this time AI must augment but not replace human judgment in academic workflows such as peer review, ethical evaluation, and validation of results. This paper calls for the deliberate adoption of AI within the scientific practice through policies that promote transparency, reproducibility, and accountability.",human
"We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.   To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.",human
"Olympiad-level physics problem-solving presents a significant challenge for both humans and artificial intelligence (AI), as it requires a sophisticated integration of precise calculation, abstract reasoning, and a fundamental grasp of physical principles.

In this paper, we introduce LOCA-R (LOgical Chain Augmentation for Reasoning), an improved version of the LOCA framework adapted for complex reasoning, and apply it to the CPhO 2025 theory examination.

"Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.",human
"Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.",human
"One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.",human
"This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.",human
"Subnational location data of disaster events are critical for risk assessment and disaster risk reduction. Disaster databases such as EM-DAT often report locations in unstructured textual form, with inconsistent granularity or spelling, that make it difficult to integrate with spatial datasets. We present a fully automated LLM-assisted workflow that processes and cleans textual location information using GPT-4o, and assigns geometries by cross-checking three independent geoinformation repositories: GADM, OpenStreetMap and Wikidata. Based on the agreement and availability of these sources, we assign a reliability score to each location while generating subnational geometries. Applied to the EM-DAT dataset from 2000 to 2024, the workflow geocodes 14,215 events across 17,948 unique locations. Unlike previous methods, our approach requires no manual intervention, covers all disaster types, enables cross-verification across multiple sources, and allows flexible remapping to preferred frameworks. Beyond the dataset, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to extract and structure geographic information from unstructured text, offering a scalable and reliable method for related analyses.",human
"We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.",human
"Optimizing recommender systems for objectives beyond accuracy, such as diversity, novelty, and personalization, is crucial for long-term user satisfaction. To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner. Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.",human
"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.",human

"Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

"Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE is publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems: https://github.com/astra-sim/symbolic tensor graph",human
"Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.",human
"Tropical Cyclone (TC) estimation aims to accurately estimate various TC attributes in real time. However, distribution shifts arising from the complex and dynamic nature of TC environmental fields, such as varying geographical conditions and seasonal changes, present significant challenges to reliable estimation. Most existing methods rely on multi-modal fusion for feature extraction but overlook the intrinsic distribution of feature representations, leading to poor generalization under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this, we propose an effective Identity Distribution-Oriented Physical Invariant Learning framework (IDOL), which imposes identity-oriented constraints to regulate the feature space under the guidance of prior physical knowledge, thereby dealing distribution variability with physical invariance. Specifically, the proposed IDOL employs the wind field model and dark correlation knowledge of TC to model task-shared and task-specific identity tokens. These tokens capture task dependencies and intrinsic physical invariances of TC, enabling robust estimation of TC wind speed, pressure, inner-core, and outer-core size under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed IDOL, verifying that imposing identity-oriented constraints based on prior physical knowledge can effectively mitigates diverse distribution shifts in TC estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/IDOL.",human
"While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

"We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.",human
"Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.",human
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.",human
"We present a concise, self-contained derivation of diffusion-based generative models. Starting from basic properties of Gaussian distributions (densities, quadratic expectations, re-parameterisation, products, and KL divergences), we construct denoising diffusion probabilistic models from first principles. This includes the forward noising process, its closed-form marginals, the exact discrete reverse posterior, and the related variational bound. This bound simplifies to the standard noise-prediction goal used in practice. We then discuss likelihood estimation and accelerated sampling, covering DDIM, adversarially learned reverse dynamics (DDGAN), and multi-scale variants such as nested and latent diffusion, with Stable Diffusion as a canonical example. A continuous-time formulation follows, in which we derive the probability-flow ODE from the diffusion SDE via the continuity and Fokker-Planck equations, introduce flow matching, and show how rectified flows recover DDIM up to a time re-parameterisation. Finally, we treat guided diffusion, interpreting classifier guidance as a posterior score correction and classifier-free guidance as a principled interpolation between conditional and unconditional scores. Throughout, the focus is on transparent algebra, explicit intermediate steps, and consistent notation, so that readers can both follow the theory and implement the corresponding algorithms in practice.",human
"Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.",human
"Standpoint logics offer unified modal logic-based formalisms for representing multiple heterogeneous viewpoints. At the same time, many non-monotonic reasoning frameworks can be naturally captured using modal logics, in particular using the modal logic S4F. In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.",human
"Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.",human
