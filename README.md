# 🧠 HUMAN_OR_AI & 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction System

This repository contains **two machine learning–based web projects**, developed with a strong focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Regression Modeling**, and **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**.

Each project addresses a real-world problem and is designed with modular, scalable, and production-ready principles.

# 🧠 HUMAN_OR_AI

**HUMAN_OR_AI** is a web application that predicts whether a given text was generated by a **human** or by **artificial intelligence**, using machine learning techniques.

The project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** methods and multiple classification algorithms, providing predictions through a Flask-based web interface.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

With the rapid growth of AI-powered text generation tools, distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated content has become increasingly important.

This project aims to build a reliable system that can classify text content as **Human-written** or **AI-generated**.

### Scope:

- Text preprocessing and analysis
- Training multiple ML classification models
- Real-time prediction via web interface

---

## 🧠 Models & Methodology (HUMAN_OR_AI)

### Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

### Text Vectorization

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)**

### Model Persistence

- Trained models and vectorizers are saved as `.pkl` files
- Loaded dynamically by the Flask application
